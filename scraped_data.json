                "Eren Jaeger is a member of the Scout Regiment, ranking 5th among the 104th Cadet Corps, and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan.",
                "",
                "If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That 'something' wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.Eren expresses his will to keep moving forward",
                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Before heading for Trost, Eren hands Hange a message detailing the conversation he had remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.[55]\n",

Eren picks up a musket to fire on the attackers, but is tranquilized alongside Historia. Despite an effort from Levi Squad to recover them, the two are ultimately kidnapped successfully.[56]\n",
                "Eren awakes in a large crystalline cavern, gagged and restrained by chains atop a raised platform. As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",
                "However, Eren refuses to transform. Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",
                "As Rod transforms himself into a Titan, Eren begs Historia to allow her father to eat him. Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",
                "After Historia is crowned as the new queen, Eren tries to talk her down as she goes to punch Levi. Historia refuses to back down and punches Levi, but Eren and his comrades are all surprised when Levi reacts by smiling and thanking them.[22]\n",
                "Two months after Historia becomes queen, Eren and the other members of the 104th volunteer at an orphanage that she has started. As Eren helps Historia, she asks about the progress of his hardening experiments. Eren says they are going well, but wants to speed up the training before Reiner and Bertholdt come back. She asks what he would do if they meet up again, and Eren says he will have to kill them. Eren compliments Historia for the work she has done, prompting Mikasa to abruptly interrupt the conversation and take Eren's load away from him.\n",

                "As Eren and his friends eat dinner in the mess hall, Eren recalls Ymir's claim that her life was like a nightmare when she was a Titan outside of the Walls. He wonders if there was a time when he was like that too, but all he remembers is what his father saw when Eren ate him. Jean jokes that a headbutt from their commandant would bring the memory back and Eren realizes that the man his father had seen before his death was Commandant Keith Sadies.\n",
                "The next morning, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Hange and Sasha visit Keith. Eren asks him to tell them all that he knows and Keith tells him how he met Grisha and everything he knows about him. Keith confesses that he is nothing more than a bystander and that he has no power to change things.[15]\n",

As Eren and Conny restrain Sasha to keep her from eating everything, the two reflect on how much things have changed in three months since the battle of Trost. Jean starts a fight with Eren by insulting him and their fight is eventually stopped by Levi.\n",

After mistaking a Garrison soldier with Hannes, Mikasa wonders if they will be able to go back to easier times when they retake Wall Maria. Eren answers that it may not be possible, but that is the reason why they must make them pay.\n",
                "The next morning, the soldiers are ready to depart on their mission. They become very surprised when they see that the civilians are cheering them. Finally, Erwin orders the start of the operation and Eren travels towards Shiganshina along with Squad Levi.[61]\n",

Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",

To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",

                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",
                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",

                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",

He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",

Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words.

When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",

Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die.\n",
                "Eren notices a young girl approaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.\n",
                "Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored. To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha. Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[81]\n",
                "Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.\n",
                "As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own. Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment.\n",
                "Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors. Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. Enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Fay to spur him into attacking the family.[82]\n",
                "Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",

                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",

                "Eren's appearance in 854",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren expresses his desire to kill the Titans",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "Eren talks some sense into Jean",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren asks Historia to eat him and save humanity",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Infant Eren",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Eren saved Mikasa from the bandits",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "Eren gave Mikasa his scarf",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "Eren argues with Hannes about soldiers needing to be vigilant",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren, Armin and Mikasa look up in horror at the sight of the Colossal Titan",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",

She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",

                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan.

                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help.

                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",

Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",

After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life.

Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds.

As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own.

Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans.

While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",

After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",

However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",

Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",

Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",

Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",

Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",

He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",

While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",

He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk.

Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",

Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",

He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out.

Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back.

Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl.

                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",

                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",

                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",

                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "Eren confronts Floch",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years.

Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",

                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",

                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",

                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",

                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",

                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy.

                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",

                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",

Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",

Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley.

Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",

Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot.

Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal.

                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren arrives at Marley",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren reveals the person Ymir waited for is Mikasa",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Eren reveals his true feelings about Mikasa",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "Eren admits his idiocy",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "Eren remains resolute",

                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "Eren's final moment",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "Eren dreams of exploring the outside world",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Eren describes the ocean to Mikasa",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "Eren is beaten by the man",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "Eren's proficiency with ODM gear",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Eren hardening his fists",
                "The Founding Titan's power",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren utilizes the War Hammer Titan",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n"

                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Before heading for Trost, Eren hands Hange a message detailing the conversation he had remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.[55]\n",
                "Eren rides alongside Historia in an enclosed wagon driven by Keiji, while Levi runs a decoy strategy with Jean and Armin posing as the two.[55] The wagon is attacked by members of the Military Police, who manage to tear the roof from the wagon using their mobility gear. Eren picks up a musket to fire on the attackers, but is tranquilized alongside Historia. Despite an effort from Levi Squad to recover them, the two are ultimately kidnapped successfully.[56]\n",
                "Eren awakes in a large crystalline cavern, gagged and restrained by chains atop a raised platform. As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",
                "However, Eren refuses to transform. Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",
                "As Rod transforms himself into a Titan, Eren begs Historia to allow her father to eat him. Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",
                "After Historia is crowned as the new queen, Eren tries to talk her down as she goes to punch Levi. Historia refuses to back down and punches Levi, but Eren and his comrades are all surprised when Levi reacts by smiling and thanking them.[22]\n",
                "Two months after Historia becomes queen, Eren and the other members of the 104th volunteer at an orphanage that she has started. As Eren helps Historia, she asks about the progress of his hardening experiments. Eren says they are going well, but wants to speed up the training before Reiner and Bertholdt come back. She asks what he would do if they meet up again, and Eren says he will have to kill them. Eren compliments Historia for the work she has done, prompting Mikasa to abruptly interrupt the conversation and take Eren's load away from him.\n",
                "Thanks to Eren's hardening experiments, a Titan guillotine is developed, giving soldiers a reusable weapon to safely kill Titans without risking their lives. However, creating the materials for one puts a strain on Eren's body.\n",
                "As Eren and his friends eat dinner in the mess hall, Eren recalls Ymir's claim that her life was like a nightmare when she was a Titan outside of the Walls. He wonders if there was a time when he was like that too, but all he remembers is what his father saw when Eren ate him. Jean jokes that a headbutt from their commandant would bring the memory back and Eren realizes that the man his father had seen before his death was Commandant Keith Sadies.\n",
                "The next morning, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Hange and Sasha visit Keith. Eren asks him to tell them all that he knows and Keith tells him how he met Grisha and everything he knows about him. Keith confesses that he is nothing more than a bystander and that he has no power to change things.[15]\n",
                "The day before the operation to retake Wall Maria, the soldiers have a feast in celebration. As Eren and Conny restrain Sasha to keep her from eating everything, the two reflect on how much things have changed in three months since the battle of Trost. Jean starts a fight with Eren by insulting him and their fight is eventually stopped by Levi.\n",
                "After the fight, Eren, Armin and Mikasa have a conversation about their future. They talk about how strong and weak people need to combine their abilities in order to succeed. After mistaking a Garrison soldier with Hannes, Mikasa wonders if they will be able to go back to easier times when they retake Wall Maria. Eren answers that it may not be possible, but that is the reason why they must make them pay.\n",
                "The next morning, the soldiers are ready to depart on their mission. They become very surprised when they see that the civilians are cheering them. Finally, Erwin orders the start of the operation and Eren travels towards Shiganshina along with Squad Levi.[61]\n",
                "Eren stands atop the Wall with Mikasa and Armin, as a guillotine-like device crushes the head of a Titan below. Mikasa thinks back at a time and place with the two, where they reminisced about the old days before the fall of Wall Maria.[62]\n",
                "While traveling on foot under the cover of night, Eren apologizes to Mikasa, who is escorting his horse in addition to her own, but she insists that he save his energy so that he can seal Wall Maria. Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",

Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",

Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",

While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",

Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",
                "After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[72]\n",
                "Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[39]\n",
                "At roughly the same time Dhalis Zachary is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. After escaping, Eren meets up with the Jaegerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[75]\n",
                "Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pyxis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire. Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her.\n",
                "Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertholdt had of her. When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",
                "Armin attacks Eren, but Mikasa suddenly grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission. He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[77]\n",
                "Eren visits Gabi in her holding cell and offers to help her save Falco in exchange for her issuing a call for help to Marley to root out any possible spies. Eren is caught by surprise when one of his soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat. He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him. Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Jaegerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.\n",
                "On the roof, he prepares to injure himself again and orders Pieck to reveal her fellow infiltrators. She points at Eren himself, and the Jaw Titan suddenly attacks Eren, taking both of his legs. Transforming, Eren spots a fleet of Marleyan airships approaching their location.[78] Eren trades several blows with the Jaw Titan before it retreats. Eren is perplexed at Marley's decision to launch a counterattack so soon after the raid on Liberio.\n",
                "Despite Yelena pleading with him to flee underground, Eren decides to fight Marley on his own. Noticing Reiner transforming into the Armored Titan while parachuting from an airship, Eren deduces that was responsible for Marley's quick response to the Liberio attack and the two proceed to engage each other.\n",
                "Eren initially overpowers Reiner, using his superior fighting skills and hardening to break through Reiner's armor plating. Reiner manages to briefly stun Eren and the Jaw Titan attempts to ambush him from behind but Eren uses the War Hammer Titan's abilities to repel them.\n",
                "Eren is shot in the head with a round from Marley's anti-Titan artillery, leaving his motor skills severely impaired. Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time. Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground.[79] Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.\n",
                "With Zeke's arrival, Eren begins trying to reach him in hopes of activating the powers of the Founding Titan while Zeke keeps Marley's Warriors at bay.[80] Eren is set upon by the Jaw Titan once again but makes short work of him, repeatedly slamming down on the Titan's head and nape. However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him. The fighting is momentarily interrupted by the arrival of Colt and Falco who reveal that Falco has accidentally ingested Zeke's spinal fluid.\n",
                "Zeke is undeterred and screams, ordering a transformed Falco to attack Reiner. Falco's Pure Titan does not prove to be enough to force Reiner to let go of Eren, so Eren exits his Titan and begins running to Zeke on foot. However, before he can reach his brother Eren is decapitated by a blast from an anti-Titan artillery rifle.\n",
                "As his head lands in his brother's hand, Eren suddenly finds himself standing before a pillar of light in an unknown land. He is greeted by a chained Zeke, who informs Eren that they are standing in the Coordinate. Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die.\n",
                "Eren notices a young girl approaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.\n",
                "Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored. To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha. Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[81]\n",
                "Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.\n",
                "As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own. Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment.\n",
                "Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors. Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. Enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Fay to spur him into attacking the family.[82]\n",
                "Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",

His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",

                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",

                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "",
                "If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That 'something' wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.Eren expresses his will to keep moving forward",
                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",

                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",

While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",

Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",

Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",

Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity.

Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",

Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",

He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite.

                "While traveling on foot under the cover of night, Eren apologizes to Mikasa, who is escorting his horse in addition to her own, but she insists that he save his energy so that he can seal Wall Maria. Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",
                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",
                "The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. When the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis, Eren quietly leaves the meeting.\n",
                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",
                "After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[72]\n",
                "Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[39]\n",
                "At roughly the same time Dhalis Zachary is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. After escaping, Eren meets up with the Jaegerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[75]\n",
                "Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pyxis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire. Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her.\n",
                "Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertholdt had of her. When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",
                "Armin attacks Eren, but Mikasa suddenly grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission. He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[77]\n",

Eren is caught by surprise when one of his soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat. He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him. Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Jaegerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.\n",

Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time. Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground.[79] Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.\n",

However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him.

Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Before heading for Trost, Eren hands Hange a message detailing the conversation he had remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.[55]\n",
                "Eren rides alongside Historia in an enclosed wagon driven by Keiji, while Levi runs a decoy strategy with Jean and Armin posing as the two.[55] The wagon is attacked by members of the Military Police, who manage to tear the roof from the wagon using their mobility gear. Eren picks up a musket to fire on the attackers, but is tranquilized alongside Historia. Despite an effort from Levi Squad to recover them, the two are ultimately kidnapped successfully.[56]\n",
                "Eren awakes in a large crystalline cavern, gagged and restrained by chains atop a raised platform. As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",
                "However, Eren refuses to transform. Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",
                "As Rod transforms himself into a Titan, Eren begs Historia to allow her father to eat him. Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",
                "After Historia is crowned as the new queen, Eren tries to talk her down as she goes to punch Levi. Historia refuses to back down and punches Levi, but Eren and his comrades are all surprised when Levi reacts by smiling and thanking them.[22]\n",
                "Two months after Historia becomes queen, Eren and the other members of the 104th volunteer at an orphanage that she has started. As Eren helps Historia, she asks about the progress of his hardening experiments. Eren says they are going well, but wants to speed up the training before Reiner and Bertholdt come back. She asks what he would do if they meet up again, and Eren says he will have to kill them. Eren compliments Historia for the work she has done, prompting Mikasa to abruptly interrupt the conversation and take Eren's load away from him.\n",
                "Thanks to Eren's hardening experiments, a Titan guillotine is developed, giving soldiers a reusable weapon to safely kill Titans without risking their lives. However, creating the materials for one puts a strain on Eren's body.\n",
                "As Eren and his friends eat dinner in the mess hall, Eren recalls Ymir's claim that her life was like a nightmare when she was a Titan outside of the Walls. He wonders if there was a time when he was like that too, but all he remembers is what his father saw when Eren ate him. Jean jokes that a headbutt from their commandant would bring the memory back and Eren realizes that the man his father had seen before his death was Commandant Keith Sadies.\n",
                "The next morning, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Hange and Sasha visit Keith. Eren asks him to tell them all that he knows and Keith tells him how he met Grisha and everything he knows about him. Keith confesses that he is nothing more than a bystander and that he has no power to change things.[15]\n",
                "The day before the operation to retake Wall Maria, the soldiers have a feast in celebration. As Eren and Conny restrain Sasha to keep her from eating everything, the two reflect on how much things have changed in three months since the battle of Trost. Jean starts a fight with Eren by insulting him and their fight is eventually stopped by Levi.\n",
                "After the fight, Eren, Armin and Mikasa have a conversation about their future. They talk about how strong and weak people need to combine their abilities in order to succeed. After mistaking a Garrison soldier with Hannes, Mikasa wonders if they will be able to go back to easier times when they retake Wall Maria. Eren answers that it may not be possible, but that is the reason why they must make them pay.\n",
                "The next morning, the soldiers are ready to depart on their mission. They become very surprised when they see that the civilians are cheering them. Finally, Erwin orders the start of the operation and Eren travels towards Shiganshina along with Squad Levi.[61]\n",
                "Eren stands atop the Wall with Mikasa and Armin, as a guillotine-like device crushes the head of a Titan below. Mikasa thinks back at a time and place with the two, where they reminisced about the old days before the fall of Wall Maria.[62]\n",
                "While traveling on foot under the cover of night, Eren apologizes to Mikasa, who is escorting his horse in addition to her own, but she insists that he save his energy so that he can seal Wall Maria. Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",

Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",

Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",

While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",

Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",
                "After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[72]\n",
                "Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[39]\n",
                "At roughly the same time Dhalis Zachary is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. After escaping, Eren meets up with the Jaegerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[75]\n",
                "Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pyxis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire. Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her.\n",
                "Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertholdt had of her. When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",
                "Armin attacks Eren, but Mikasa suddenly grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission. He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[77]\n",
                "Eren visits Gabi in her holding cell and offers to help her save Falco in exchange for her issuing a call for help to Marley to root out any possible spies. Eren is caught by surprise when one of his soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat. He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him. Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Jaegerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.\n",
                "On the roof, he prepares to injure himself again and orders Pieck to reveal her fellow infiltrators. She points at Eren himself, and the Jaw Titan suddenly attacks Eren, taking both of his legs. Transforming, Eren spots a fleet of Marleyan airships approaching their location.[78] Eren trades several blows with the Jaw Titan before it retreats. Eren is perplexed at Marley's decision to launch a counterattack so soon after the raid on Liberio.\n",
                "Despite Yelena pleading with him to flee underground, Eren decides to fight Marley on his own. Noticing Reiner transforming into the Armored Titan while parachuting from an airship, Eren deduces that was responsible for Marley's quick response to the Liberio attack and the two proceed to engage each other.\n",
                "Eren initially overpowers Reiner, using his superior fighting skills and hardening to break through Reiner's armor plating. Reiner manages to briefly stun Eren and the Jaw Titan attempts to ambush him from behind but Eren uses the War Hammer Titan's abilities to repel them.\n",
                "Eren is shot in the head with a round from Marley's anti-Titan artillery, leaving his motor skills severely impaired. Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time. Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground.[79] Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.\n",
                "With Zeke's arrival, Eren begins trying to reach him in hopes of activating the powers of the Founding Titan while Zeke keeps Marley's Warriors at bay.[80] Eren is set upon by the Jaw Titan once again but makes short work of him, repeatedly slamming down on the Titan's head and nape. However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him. The fighting is momentarily interrupted by the arrival of Colt and Falco who reveal that Falco has accidentally ingested Zeke's spinal fluid.\n",
                "Zeke is undeterred and screams, ordering a transformed Falco to attack Reiner. Falco's Pure Titan does not prove to be enough to force Reiner to let go of Eren, so Eren exits his Titan and begins running to Zeke on foot. However, before he can reach his brother Eren is decapitated by a blast from an anti-Titan artillery rifle.\n",
                "As his head lands in his brother's hand, Eren suddenly finds himself standing before a pillar of light in an unknown land. He is greeted by a chained Zeke, who informs Eren that they are standing in the Coordinate. Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die.\n",
                "Eren notices a young girl approaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.\n",
                "Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored. To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha. Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[81]\n",
                "Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.\n",
                "As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own. Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment.\n",
                "Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors. Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. Enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Fay to spur him into attacking the family.[82]\n",
                "Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",

                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "",
                "If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That 'something' wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.Eren expresses his will to keep moving forward",
                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia.

As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",

Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",

Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",

He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",
                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",
                "The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. When the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis, Eren quietly leaves the meeting.\n",
                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",

Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time.

He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire.

When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",

As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Before heading for Trost, Eren hands Hange a message detailing the conversation he had remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.[55]\n",
                "Eren rides alongside Historia in an enclosed wagon driven by Keiji, while Levi runs a decoy strategy with Jean and Armin posing as the two.[55] The wagon is attacked by members of the Military Police, who manage to tear the roof from the wagon using their mobility gear. Eren picks up a musket to fire on the attackers, but is tranquilized alongside Historia. Despite an effort from Levi Squad to recover them, the two are ultimately kidnapped successfully.[56]\n",
                "Eren awakes in a large crystalline cavern, gagged and restrained by chains atop a raised platform. As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",
                "However, Eren refuses to transform. Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",
                "As Rod transforms himself into a Titan, Eren begs Historia to allow her father to eat him. Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",
                "After Historia is crowned as the new queen, Eren tries to talk her down as she goes to punch Levi. Historia refuses to back down and punches Levi, but Eren and his comrades are all surprised when Levi reacts by smiling and thanking them.[22]\n",
                "Two months after Historia becomes queen, Eren and the other members of the 104th volunteer at an orphanage that she has started. As Eren helps Historia, she asks about the progress of his hardening experiments. Eren says they are going well, but wants to speed up the training before Reiner and Bertholdt come back. She asks what he would do if they meet up again, and Eren says he will have to kill them. Eren compliments Historia for the work she has done, prompting Mikasa to abruptly interrupt the conversation and take Eren's load away from him.\n",
                "Thanks to Eren's hardening experiments, a Titan guillotine is developed, giving soldiers a reusable weapon to safely kill Titans without risking their lives. However, creating the materials for one puts a strain on Eren's body.\n",
                "As Eren and his friends eat dinner in the mess hall, Eren recalls Ymir's claim that her life was like a nightmare when she was a Titan outside of the Walls. He wonders if there was a time when he was like that too, but all he remembers is what his father saw when Eren ate him. Jean jokes that a headbutt from their commandant would bring the memory back and Eren realizes that the man his father had seen before his death was Commandant Keith Sadies.\n",
                "The next morning, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Hange and Sasha visit Keith. Eren asks him to tell them all that he knows and Keith tells him how he met Grisha and everything he knows about him. Keith confesses that he is nothing more than a bystander and that he has no power to change things.[15]\n",
                "The day before the operation to retake Wall Maria, the soldiers have a feast in celebration. As Eren and Conny restrain Sasha to keep her from eating everything, the two reflect on how much things have changed in three months since the battle of Trost. Jean starts a fight with Eren by insulting him and their fight is eventually stopped by Levi.\n",
                "After the fight, Eren, Armin and Mikasa have a conversation about their future. They talk about how strong and weak people need to combine their abilities in order to succeed. After mistaking a Garrison soldier with Hannes, Mikasa wonders if they will be able to go back to easier times when they retake Wall Maria. Eren answers that it may not be possible, but that is the reason why they must make them pay.\n",
                "The next morning, the soldiers are ready to depart on their mission. They become very surprised when they see that the civilians are cheering them. Finally, Erwin orders the start of the operation and Eren travels towards Shiganshina along with Squad Levi.[61]\n",
                "Eren stands atop the Wall with Mikasa and Armin, as a guillotine-like device crushes the head of a Titan below. Mikasa thinks back at a time and place with the two, where they reminisced about the old days before the fall of Wall Maria.[62]\n",
                "While traveling on foot under the cover of night, Eren apologizes to Mikasa, who is escorting his horse in addition to her own, but she insists that he save his energy so that he can seal Wall Maria. Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",

The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",

Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",

Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",

While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",

The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",
                "After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[72]\n",
                "Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[39]\n",
                "At roughly the same time Dhalis Zachary is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. After escaping, Eren meets up with the Jaegerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[75]\n",
                "Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pyxis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire. Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her.\n",
                "Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertholdt had of her. When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",
                "Armin attacks Eren, but Mikasa suddenly grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission. He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[77]\n",
                "Eren visits Gabi in her holding cell and offers to help her save Falco in exchange for her issuing a call for help to Marley to root out any possible spies. Eren is caught by surprise when one of his soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat. He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him. Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Jaegerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.\n",
                "On the roof, he prepares to injure himself again and orders Pieck to reveal her fellow infiltrators. She points at Eren himself, and the Jaw Titan suddenly attacks Eren, taking both of his legs. Transforming, Eren spots a fleet of Marleyan airships approaching their location.[78] Eren trades several blows with the Jaw Titan before it retreats. Eren is perplexed at Marley's decision to launch a counterattack so soon after the raid on Liberio.\n",
                "Despite Yelena pleading with him to flee underground, Eren decides to fight Marley on his own. Noticing Reiner transforming into the Armored Titan while parachuting from an airship, Eren deduces that was responsible for Marley's quick response to the Liberio attack and the two proceed to engage each other.\n",
                "Eren initially overpowers Reiner, using his superior fighting skills and hardening to break through Reiner's armor plating. Reiner manages to briefly stun Eren and the Jaw Titan attempts to ambush him from behind but Eren uses the War Hammer Titan's abilities to repel them.\n",
                "Eren is shot in the head with a round from Marley's anti-Titan artillery, leaving his motor skills severely impaired. Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time. Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground.[79] Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.\n",
                "With Zeke's arrival, Eren begins trying to reach him in hopes of activating the powers of the Founding Titan while Zeke keeps Marley's Warriors at bay.[80] Eren is set upon by the Jaw Titan once again but makes short work of him, repeatedly slamming down on the Titan's head and nape. However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him. The fighting is momentarily interrupted by the arrival of Colt and Falco who reveal that Falco has accidentally ingested Zeke's spinal fluid.\n",
                "Zeke is undeterred and screams, ordering a transformed Falco to attack Reiner. Falco's Pure Titan does not prove to be enough to force Reiner to let go of Eren, so Eren exits his Titan and begins running to Zeke on foot. However, before he can reach his brother Eren is decapitated by a blast from an anti-Titan artillery rifle.\n",
                "As his head lands in his brother's hand, Eren suddenly finds himself standing before a pillar of light in an unknown land. He is greeted by a chained Zeke, who informs Eren that they are standing in the Coordinate. Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die.\n",
                "Eren notices a young girl approaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.\n",
                "Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored. To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha. Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[81]\n",
                "Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.\n",
                "As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own. Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment.\n",
                "Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors. Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. Enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Fay to spur him into attacking the family.[82]\n",
                "Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

                "",
                "If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That 'something' wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.Eren expresses his will to keep moving forward",
                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",

Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",

As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",

Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",

Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity.

Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",

Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",

He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite.

Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",

To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",
                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",
                "The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. When the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis, Eren quietly leaves the meeting.\n",
                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",
                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",

Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time.

He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire.

When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",

However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n",

He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren's appearance in 854",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren expresses his desire to kill the Titans",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "Eren talks some sense into Jean",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren asks Historia to eat him and save humanity",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Infant Eren",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Eren saved Mikasa from the bandits",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "Eren gave Mikasa his scarf",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "Eren argues with Hannes about soldiers needing to be vigilant",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren, Armin and Mikasa look up in horror at the sight of the Colossal Titan",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",

                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Eren shortly after receiving his Titan powers from his father",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan.

                "Eren tells the cadets his memories of Shiganshina",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help.

                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",

Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",

                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",

Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",

As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own.

Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans.

Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",

                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "Eren calls desperately for Annie to prove her innocence",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Eren fights Annie for the second time in Stohess District",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",

While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",

                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk.

Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",

                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",

He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",

                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses.

Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",

                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",

Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren.

After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",

The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "Eren pensively points at the sea",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "Eren lifts the Marleyan ship",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "Eren refuses Zeke's plan",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",

                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "Eren offers to erase Historia's memory",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Eren refuses to let Eldians die out",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren apologizes to Ramzi",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa what he is to her",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",
                "The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. When the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis, Eren quietly leaves the meeting.\n",
                "Eren cuts off his leg",
                "In 854, before the end of the Marley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[32] He returns to Liberio as he watches Reiner and the Warrior candidates from a distance and is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",
                "While staying in a mental hospital, Eren spots Falco again and invites the youth to sit with him. He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Eren speaks about his resolve to always push forward",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",
                "Eren is reunited with Reiner",
                "Just before the start of the Tybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital, runs into Falco, and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him. Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",
                "Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",
                "Eren crushes Willy",
                "Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue to move forward until he wipes out his enemies. Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",

                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",

                "As Eren is about to eat Lara Tybur's crystal, the Jaw Titan appears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",

He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home.

Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words.

Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time.

Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire.

When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers.

He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "Eren admits his idiocy",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "Eren remains resolute",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "Eren's final moment",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "Eren dreams of exploring the outside world",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Eren describes the ocean to Mikasa",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "Eren is beaten by the man",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "Eren's proficiency with ODM gear",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Eren hardening his fists",
                "The Founding Titan's power",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",
                "Eren utilizes the War Hammer Titan",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create numerous weapons and structures.\n\n"

                "If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That 'something' wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.Eren expresses his will to keep moving forward",
                "Eren Jaeger (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Scout Regiment and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He was the only son of Grisha and Carla Jaeger, the younger paternal half brother of Zeke Jaeger,[24] and the last holder of the Attack Titan, Founding Titan,[25] and the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of Titans to invade and destroy the city. During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan.[24] This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the earth.[26]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan injection.[27]\n",
                "Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps.[28] The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost.[29]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea.[30]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[10]\n",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. He had a fairly long, yet rounded face, and sizable, expressive, teal-green eyes. His eyebrows were sparse and often furrowed, making him seem troubled or annoyed. Eren's hair was short and dark brown, with his bangs falling naturally into a middle-parted, curtain-type style. His complexion also seemed somewhat tan. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing regular townsfolk attire, which consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a maroon coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a red scarf, which he gave to Mikasa the day they met. Eren was often seen in the typical Scout Regiment uniform when training. His casual attire consisted of a long, beige shirt (identical to that which he wore on his first appearance) that was worn with a maroon sash about his waist, brown trousers, and brown shoes. He always kept the key that was given to him by his father around his neck on a string.[26]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrated Marley in the year 854, he had grown visibly taller, and his hair had grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that covered his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[23] Later when he was imprisoned for the second time following his infiltration in Marley, he tied his shoulder length hair into a man-bun style which shows two of his small fringes in each sides and being cleanly shaved.\n",
                "As a Titan, Eren's appearance changed quite drastically. Along with a massive increase in height (to 15 m), his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, with his tongue and ears becoming elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation. Along with a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes were deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that is unsuited for intelligible speech, though he was capable of howling and roaring when expressing his exhaustion and anger. He also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, exposing all his teeth. A third transparent eyelid could also be seen on both of his eyes.\n",
                "Similar to other intelligent Titans, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearance of regular Titans.\n",
                "In its burning state seen when it lifted the boulder in Trost and when it fought the Female Titan, the Titan was deep black, had burning marks all over his Titan, and had blue eyes and sharp teeth instead of straight teeth.\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[31] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[11], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. It towered over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extend far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ribcage. The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the rumbling.[32]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It had short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. The Pure Titan form also had a stocky build, a big head, and elongated ears.\n",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which were attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls. As a young child, he was so intent on joining the Scout Regiment that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and compared them to complacent livestock.[24]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for Armin, his best and only friend before he met Mikasa, and most importantly, his family, risking harm and even death in order to help them. This quality was most often demonstrated in the form of Eren as a child taking on the larger boys who would bully Armin without hesitation; more tragically when he desperately attempted to lift the rubble crushing his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[24] In contrast, Eren was also capable of displaying very violent behavior in the defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he brutally slaughtered two of the human traffickers who captured Mikasa in order to rescue her, despite the fact that they were total strangers at the time.[33] Since witnessing his mother's gruesome demise and losing contact with his father, his fierce protectiveness to those he has left has only intensified.\n",
                "Eren had a number of defining traits that date back to his childhood. He came to share Armin's awe of the lands beyond the Walls after the latter showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, and decided to see it all for himself.[1] This led him to develop a scornful attitude to anyone content to live and die within the confines of the Walls without ever setting foot outside. This very contempt may have been the reason he did not easily make friends with his peers. He resented both the Walls that \"caged\" them in like cattle and the Titans that had driven humanity to erect them in the first place. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Scout Regiment, regarding them as \"heroes,\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He easily took offense when anyone spoke badly of the Scout Regiment, and his determination to join their ranks caused friction between himself and his mother, as well as to Mikasa.[24]\n",
                "Eren had a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing both his friends and family to worry about him. His limited self-control and reckless behavior extended to his temper, and as a result, it was short at best and murderous at the very worst. When sufficiently provoked, his anger could drive him into a frenzy, accompanied by horrific levels of violence. Like many children, he tended to view the world in terms of black-and-white, having great compassion for humanity and its plight, but deeming those individuals who deny others their freedom as worthless scum unfit to be left alive. He also had the habit of thinking with his heart rather than his head, even in situations where his own life was in danger.[24]\n",
                "These characteristic qualities had become more highly pronounced since his mother's death. He then focused his destructive rage on the Titans, holding a virulent hatred for them, with the goal to rid the world of Titans one day.[26] Fueled by vengeance, he vowed to personally wipe every single one of them out and restore mankind to its rightful place. Though he feeled great remorse for quarreling with his mother till the very end, he still continued to go against her wishes by seeking entry to the Scout Regiment. So strong was his desire to exterminate the Titans, he was plunged into despair when it seemed he could not even master the basics of the omni-directional mobility gear during training when his failure was in fact due to faulty equipment.[28] He was unafraid to voice his intentions of leaving the Walls to eliminate the Titans and was so consumed by his hatred that he seemed not to fear them at all, earning him the nickname \"suicidal bastard\" from the other cadets.[34] Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities.\n",
                "He possessed great amounts of selflessness, perseverance, fortitude, and a vigorous determination; managing to graduate fifth in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[29] He greatly appreciated and/or admired his comrades, and would swiftly fly into a rage if one of them was injured or killed in front of him. He prized human life, but his personal sense of justice dictated that anyone who stole away the freedom and dreams of others deserved to die. Though his ordeals since the struggle for Trost have taught him restraint, Eren still tended to behave quite rashly and spoke his mind even when he knew he should not.[35] This had put him in grave danger on numerous occasions, and he often found himself having to be rescued.\n",
                "Eren, however, tended to lose confidence in himself and blame his incompetence when confronted with how he could do little to nothing whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This includes when Eren put his trust in the Special Operations Squad when he could have fought the Female Titan himself, resulting in the deaths of all of his squadmates save for Levi[36], and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.\n",
                "Whilst assuming his Titan form, Eren seemed to become more savage, bloodthirsty, and all-around uncontrollable. Though he was able to consciously control his Titan body after the struggle for Trost, he could very easily become caught up in the pleasure of slaughtering his enemies, smiling as he prepared to torture or kill them, and indulging in thoughts so brutal he gave the impression of being insane.[36][37]\n",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état had mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about his father the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity. He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans are actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan a \"fellow patriot.\"[30]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirschtein, his bitter rival, has admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Scout Regiment before the Battle of Trost.[29] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifts Falco's spirits and convinces him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians are usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[8]\n",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Scout Regiment, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[23] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[9] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[10]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[9]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom, regardless of how many lives are lost on either side.[7] In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[23]\n",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[9]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[8] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[38] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[39] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Braus's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirschtein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[40]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[41]\n",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlelt, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world.[1] He dreamed of joining the Scout Regiment as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were regarded as heretics and harassed.[24]\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old, he saved Mikasa Ackermann from being sold into slavery by bandits. On a visit to the Ackermanns' home, he and his father discovered both parents murdered and their daughter missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Jaeger instructed Eren to wait at the foot of the mountain while he got the Military Police Regiment to conduct a search. However, Eren, wanting to rescue the missing girl as soon as possible, managed to track the bandits' trail to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.\n",
                "Opening the door to the room where Mikasa was being held captive, he found her laying on the floor with two of the bandits keeping watch. Feigning distress and saying that he was lost, Eren got them to drop their guard.\n",
                "As one of them closed in to pat his head, Eren slit his throat with a knife he had hidden behind his back and quickly ducked back out of the room. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged at him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on in horror. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by the third bandit, who proceeded to strangle him. Mikasa picked up the knife Eren used but balked at the thought of using it to kill someone. Eren urged her to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him instantly.\n",
                "When Dr. Jaeger eventually returned with the police in tow, he took Eren aside scolded him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the bandits. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Jaeger invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[33]\n",
                "After waking up from a nightmare interrupted by Mikasa, they stroll through the city and Eren expresses anger at being kept like cattle within the Walls, revealing his intentions in joining the Scout Regiment. Mikasa scolds him, not taking his words seriously, and later reveals what he said to their parents.\n",
                "Carla is shocked and angered, saying she will not let him join the Scouts due to their high mortality rate. She begs Grisha to talk some sense into Eren, but Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip and that when he comes back, he will show Eren what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Scout Regiment, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing their neighborhood friend Armin Arlelt. Eren offers Armin a hand but Armin rejects, expressing discontent with his abilities to protect himself and admits he is weak. The three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank, where Eren reveals his intentions of joining the Scout Regiment to Armin.\n",
                "Suddenly, lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.\n",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. She says that the rubble crushed her legs and she can not move, but Eren insists that he will carry her to safety. As they argue, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. A Garrison member, Hannes, arrives and Carla begs that he takes the kids and run. Hannes rushes to kill the Titan and save Carla, but quickly changes his mind and takes Eren and Mikasa away. As Hannes carries the two on his shoulders and retreats, Eren witnesses as the Titan eats his mother.[24]\n",
                "As the evacuation of Shiganshina is underway, Eren, Mikasa, and Hannes arrive in an alley and Eren starts attacking Hannes with leaving his mother. Hannes says that the reason Eren could not save her was that even though he had the courage, he lacked the strength, and Hannes himself lacked the courage even though he had the strength.\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on the boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroy the back gate of Shiganshina. Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are forced to depart on the boat as Eren realizes that he can never return home, and vows to kill every Titan in existence.[26]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha finds Eren and takes him into a nearby forest. Grisha instructs Eren to retake Wall Maria and gives him the key to the basement,[26] before giving him a Titan injection that turns him into a Pure Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, granting him the Power of the Titans.[25]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly stay in a landfill working on a farm before reaching the proper age to enroll in the military.\n",
                "After these two years, they begin their first day on the training grounds in the 104th Cadet Corps as commandant Keith Sadies grills the fresh recruits as part of their \"Rite of Passage.\" Eren restores his vow to kill all Titans, and that next time around, they will be the ones who will be devoured.[26]\n",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of cadets at dinnertime, describing the fall of Wall Maria to them. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and join the Scouts. Jean Kirschtein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision, nearly leading to a fight between them. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.\n",
                "The next day, the cadets begin practicing with omni-directional mobility gear. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other cadets mock his performance.\n",
                "Back at the dorm, Conny and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.\n",
                "Sadies gives Eren one last chance to pass his ODM test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Sadies has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Sadies reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[28]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented cadets with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of cadets trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.\n",
                "The graduation of the cadets draws closer until Eren finally graduates in the top 10 of the 104th Cadet Corps. After graduation, he is assigned to clean the cannons atop Wall Rose with Sasha, Conny, and a few others. There they witness the return of the Colossal Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years.[29]\n",
                "In the year 848, Eren and his fellow cadets embark on a navigation training exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace, during which he and Jean continually get at each other's throats.\n",
                "During the night, the group is ambushed while they sleep. Held at gunpoint, they are unable to do anything as the thieves carry off their ODM gear and Christa Lenz. Marco Bodt suggests abandoning the mission and getting help from Sadies, but Eren convinces the group to help him chase down the thieves before they can get away. Sasha suggests using a higher vantage point to look for the bandits, and the group is able to successfully locate where the thieves are camping for the night.\n",
                "The group devises a plan to confront the bandits. After Conny and Sasha successfully block off the bandits' route out of the forest, Marco is able to determine which of their carriages they are carrying the cadets' stolen goods in, and alerts Eren and Jean so that they can attack. When Eren and Jean are able to recover the cadets' ODM gear, but not Christa, they use their gear to continue their pursuit. The group confronts the bandits again, but are left unable to fight when the men begin threatening Christa's life. Helpless, they are forced to hand over their gear again, only to be saved by the timely arrival of Thomas' group, who successfully ambush and capture the attackers.\n",
                "Following the incident, Marco has a conversation with Eren, stating his belief that Jean would have made a much better choice to lead the mission, to which Eren vehemently disagrees.[42]\n",
                "In the year 849, Eren and Mikasa confusedly watch a brewing fight between Sasha and Jean. Afterward, he attempts to unload a crate from a wagon but was unable to due to its weight. Meanwhile, he looks over at Mikasa, who is carrying three without any trouble. She offers to help him with his, but he angrily refuses. Later in the dining hall, Eren advises Jean to be nicer to his mother.[43]\n",
                "When the newly graduated recruits of the 104th are assigned to clean the cannons on top of Wall Rose, the Colossal Titan appears for the first time in five years. Eren faces the Titan alone, but despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air after kicking down Trost's outer gate and dismantling the cannons atop the Wall.\n",
                "In response to the crisis, the new recruits are split into squads in charge of defending different parts of the city. Despite their nerves, Eren's squad enters the battle in high spirits, viewing the upcoming battle as an opportunity to prove their mettle as soldiers before they enter the Scouts. However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Conny, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their ODM gear.\n",
                "Eventually, Eren appears to run out of energy and begins to be overwhelmed by the Titans. The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[27] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.[14]\n",
                "Armin's plea falls on deaf ears among the soldiers who have cornered them, but the trio is saved by the arrival of Commander Dot Pyxis, who intervenes on their behalf. Pyxis takes the three to the top of Wall Rose and questions Eren personally. Eren's answers satisfy Pyxis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",
                "Upon his transformation to execute the plan, Eren loses control and attacks Mikasa before inadvertently rendering himself unconscious. When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Scout Regiment and destroy all the Titans. Eren moves the stone and is able to plug the hole in the Wall. His strength expended, Eren emerges from his Titan and his group is attacked from behind by two Titans. They are saved by the timely arrival of Captain Levi, who has arrived ahead of the returning Scout Regiment.\n",
                "After the events of Trost, Eren is placed in the custody of the Military Police and kept chained in a dungeon prison cell in the Royal Capital beneath a courtroom. While he is there, he is paid a visit by Commander Erwin Smith and Captain Levi. Upon hearing his motive to kill Titans, Levi says he will accept him into the Scout Regiment. Eren is left there for some time before being escorted by Scout Regiment members to the courtroom where he was tried, with Premier Dhalis Zachary preceding over events.\n",
                "During his trial, the Military Police and Order of the Walls call for his dissection and execution while the Scout Regiment, argues in favor of using his power to their advantage in scouting missions. After an outburst by Eren, Levi savagely beats him to prove that Eren will not pose a threat to him. It is decided his fate will be decided after a “test” mission with the Scout Regiment. Afterward, Erwin thanks him for his cooperation.\n",
                "After joining the Scout Regiment, Eren is assigned to Levi's Special Operations Squad and sent to an abandoned castle which had formerly served as the base of operations for the Scout Regiment. While there, he is tasked with cleaning duty by Levi while also helping Squad Leader Hange Zoë with their Titan experiments.[44]\n",
                "During one of the experiments with his Titan abilities, Eren is lowered into a well before being told to transform into a Titan, in case he loses control. However, Eren is unable to activate his Titan abilities. He is eventually brought back to the surface and have his wounds tended to by Levi's squad, who express their relief at his inability to turn into a Titan. However, whilst bending over to pick up a dropped spoon with his injured hand, Eren accidentally triggers his Titan ability in a partial transformation, creating a Titan hand in a small explosion.\n",
                "Levi's squad surrounds Eren, demanding that he prove he is not a threat to them, and the situation has to be defused by Levi and Hange. After the incident, with the help of Hange's deductions, Eren learns that a Titan transformation requires him to have a clear goal in mind in addition to self-injury.[38]\n",
                "While he is with Levi's squad, Eren meets some of his classmates from the 104th Cadet Corps who have opted to join the Scout Regiment. Eren is surprised to see Jean among them and is given a lecture by Jean about his responsibilities to humanity.[45]\n",
                "After a month of training, Eren and the Scout Regiment embark on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. After leaving the safety of the Walls, the Scouts assume the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation with Eren positioned at the center of the formation, where it is the safest.[34]\n",
                "It soon becomes apparent to Eren that something is going wrong with the expedition as his squad receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and notice black flares, despite the fact that they are in the safest position in the formation. Soon after, the Scouts head toward a Forest of Giant Trees. The central column of the scouting force, including Eren and Levi's squad, are told to enter the forest, while the rest of the soldiers were to stand guard at the perimeter of the forest to prevent any Titans from entering.\n",
                "Soon after entering the forest, Squad Levi is set upon by a seemingly intelligent Female Titan, who is able to dispatch pursuing soldiers with ease. Seeing the soldiers perish one by one, Eren is tempted to use his Titan power to fight the Female Titan. Levi allows this choice, but recalling Levi and his squad's trust in him when he accidentally used his Titan powers, Eren decides to trust in his team instead.[38]\n",
                "As the Female Titan is inches from grabbing Eren, it is ambushed by a trap set by the Scouts. Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended. This is proved false as the unidentifiable human form of the Female Titan kills Gunther before re-transforming into a Titan. The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan. Eren expressed his desire to stay and fight with them, but again, is convinced otherwise and begins to retreat. Although the three soldiers manage to blind the Female Titan and cripple her arms, they were caught off guard when the Female Titan regenerates an eye much faster than they had expected, resulting in their deaths. Upon seeing this, Eren, filled with regret, finally transforms into a Titan and engages the Female Titan.[36]\n",
                "Even though he initially had the upper hand against the crippled Female Titan, Eren quickly spends all of his energy and ultimately loses the fight. Mikasa pursues the Female Titan as it flees with Eren and is able to save him with Levi's help.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment returns to Wall Rose in defeat, with the failure of the mission to capture the Female Titan and the loss of the lives of many soldiers. Due to the mission's failure, Eren is ordered to be handed over to the Military in Wall Sina.[46]\n",
                "Before Eren can be handed over to the Military, he is let in on a plan by Commander Erwin to capture the Female Titan, whom Armin has deduced to be Annie Leonhart. Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow cadets is possible. However, after Mikasa tells him to think back to when he was fighting against the Female Titan in the forest, he realizes that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's, forcing him to come to terms with Annie's betrayal. He agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[47]\n",
                "After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out of the city, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel, where she refuses to continue following them. Despite Eren's continued pleas for her to join them and prove her innocence, Annie transforms and he, Mikasa, and Armin are forced into the underground tunnel to escape from her Titan. As per the plan, Eren tries to transform but can not because of his disbelief at Annie's betrayal. As the Scout Regiment tries in vain to capture the Female Titan, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions, transform into his Titan form, and engage the Female Titan for the second time.[47]\n",
                "Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability. He manages to throw Annie into some buildings, but gets his right leg taken off by a hardened kick from Annie, who proceeds to slam him into a building and pummel his head repeatedly with her hardened fist.\n",
                "Unexpectedly, Annie stops her assault on Eren and flees toward the wall, giving him the opportunity to drive himself into a rage, chasing after the Female Titan. She is able to kick him aside and attempt to climb up the Wall with her hardened fingers, but Eren grabs hold of one of her legs. He is kicked off by Annie, but Mikasa slices her Titan's fingers off, causing her to fall back to the ground where Eren can restrain her. He tears her head off and bites her nape clean off of her body, exposing Annie's human form inside. However, upon seeing Annie crying, Eren stops himself. This gives Annie a chance to use her hardening ability, encasing herself in a crystal, which causes her Titan body to start merging with Eren as well. Eren is saved by Levi, who cuts him out of his Titan before he can be encased.\n",
                "Some time later, Eren wakes up in his bed, having recovered from his injuries. He is aware of Annie being frozen, with Jean confirming that they got nothing from the operation. Unexpectedly, Armin states that Eren is the one who let that happen. After a short hesitation, Eren confirms that upon seeing Annie, he could not move. After Armin and Jean leave, Eren confides to Mikasa about his feelings during the battle. Mikasa expresses herself to be happy that he returned alive.[37]\n",
                "When Wall Rose is supposedly breached, Eren is among one of the teams within the area to survey the Wall for the breach. While en route to Ehrmich District, Eren is appalled to learn that Pastor Nick helped keep the Colossal Titans inside of the Walls a secret and begs him to tell them anything else he might know. Nick proves to be tight-lipped and Hange instead decides to inform Eren of their plan to try to replicate the Female Titan's hardening ability in Eren so that he can use his own Titan's body to seal Wall Rose.\n",
                "After learning from Nick that Christa Lenz will be able to divulge more secrets about the Walls, Eren accompanies Hange's squad to Utgard Castle to save the soldiers trapped there. The soldiers arrive just in time to save their comrades, excluding the members of Squad Miche who have already died. During the rescue Eren kills his first Titan while in human form but is scolded for breaking cover and endangering himself.[20]\n",
                "In the aftermath, Eren is among the soldiers on top the Wall recovering from the ordeal at Utgard. He questions Ymir's condition and gives Reiner a hand up the Wall as Historia explains her true parentage. Helping Armin up as well, Eren checks on Reiner after hearing about how his arm was injured in Utgard Castle; this, along with the moment he was almost killed by the Female Titan, causes Reiner to comment that he does not expect to live much longer and that they should keep fighting until the breach in Wall Maria is covered. Bertholdt reassures Reiner that they do not have to wait much longer and can return home soon. Hannes arrives with news that there is no hole or breach in the Wall, confusing everyone and prompting Eren to question if Hannes is drunk. As Hange orders them to stay on standby in Trost District, Reiner wishes to speak with Eren in private.[48]\n",
                "Reiner reveals that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans respectively, and tells Eren that they will cease their attack on the Walls if Eren returns to their homeland with them. Eren recalls Hange inquiring about Reiner and Bertholdt potentially being accomplices to Annie and tries to persuade Reiner that he is tired and simply not thinking straight. In response to Eren's disbelief, Reiner removes the bandage on his arm and reveals that his wounds are regenerating. Mikasa attempts to intervene and protect Eren but Reiner and Bertholdt transform into their Titan forms and attack. Reiner grabs Eren while Bertholdt kidnaps Ymir and Eren, disgusted by his former friends, transforms himself.[48]\n",
                "Eren and Reiner grapple with one another while Hange's squad attempts to take Bertholdt down. Eren grows increasingly angry as he remembers all of the pain Reiner and Bertholdt have inflicted but he is unable to do any damage to Reiner with brute force due to the latter's armor. Instead, he opts to uses Annie's fighting techniques, grappling with Reiner until he locks his foe in a submission hold. As Eren holds Reiner, he focuses pressure on one of Reiner's arms, breaking the armor around the joints and tearing the arm off completely.[49]\n",
                "With Reiner crippled, Eren falls back to the Wall where Hange orders him to find a way to destroy Reiner's legs so that he can flee without being pursued. Eren is caught off guard by Reiner attacking him head on, but he manages to lock Reiner in another submission hold. As Mikasa slashes Reiner's legs, Eren begins applying pressure to his nape, causing its armor to crack. However, before he can break Reiner out of his Titan Reiner begins roaring, causing Bertholdt's Titan to roll off the top of the wall, landing atop both of them.[50]\n",
                "Eren and Ymir are taken to the Forest of Giant Trees by Reiner and Bertholdt. He attempts to transform into his Titan form in spite of losing his arms, but Ymir tells him his body is already expending too much energy to transform.[51] While she questions Reiner and Bertholdt about the Beast Titan they are after, Eren broods in silence as Reiner reveals that humanity has no hope in fighting against the Titans. He and Bertholdt offer both him and Ymir a chance to join them in order to protect their loved ones. Eren furiously refuses and blames both Reiner and Bertholdt for causing the hardship he has had to endure. Eren continues to violently resist his captors, causing Reiner to knock him out. His unconscious form is strapped to Bertholdt's back to be carried.[52]\n",
                "Eren awakes in the midst of an attempt by the Scouts to rescue him and immediately begins resisting his captors again. In an attempt to free himself from Pure Titans which have begun to attack him, Reiner is forced to stop using his hands to cover Eren and Bertholdt, exposing them and giving Mikasa the opportunity to attack Bertholdt. As she rushes forward, Bertholdt dodges and Eren tries in vain to warn Mikasa of a Titan behind her.[53]\n",
                "Armin distracts Bertholdt, giving Erwin enough time to cut Eren free from his captors. Mikasa then grabs him before landing on their horses. As they flee, a large Titan is sent flying and creates a large explosion of dust. This causes some soldiers to fall off their horses including Eren and Mikasa. As the two pick themselves up, they are horrified to see the Titan which ate Carla approaching them.[53]\n",
                "Hannes steps forward to protect Eren and Mikasa. While he distracts the Titan, Eren shouts for Mikasa to free him, believing that he is the only one who can stop this now. But when he tries to transform into a Titan, nothing happens because he is still recovering from his injuries.[54]\n",
                "He is devastated when Hannes gets eaten, devastated at the thought that nothing has changed from when he was 10 and was powerless to save either his mother or Hannes. Mikasa attempts to reassure him, telling Eren that she wants to thank him for teaching her how to live, and for wrapping his muffler on her which she always wears. Filled with newfound conviction, Eren vows to Mikasa that he will wrap the muffler around her as many times as he needs to. In a desperate attempt, Eren punches the Smiling Titan in the hand as it reaches for him. Eren screams and another Titan attacks the Smiling Titan. Elsewhere around them, the Titans that were fighting the soldiers turn and start running to the Smiling Titan, surrounding and devouring it.[54] Eren takes advantage of the situation and flees, carrying Mikasa on his back. When Reiner and Bertholdt pursue him, he screams again, and the Titans turn to attack them.\n",
                "Eren escapes with the rest of the surviving soldiers and they return to Trost District, where he learns that the Scout Regiment lost more than half its veteran soldiers in rescuing him. No casualties were incurred on the way back, and Armin and Jean theorize that it is because Eren was somehow able to control them. Eren resolves to learn how to control the Titans, seal Wall Maria, and make Reiner pay as a way to atone for all the lives lost.[54]\n",
                "Some time afterward, Eren and Historia are sent away with the new Squad Levi to be safeguarded in an isolated cabin in the forest. Eren frantically attempts to clean their hideout before Levi's arrival, scolding Jean for the lackluster cleaning on his part. When Levi arrives, he is dissatisfied with their cleaning, much to Eren's dismay. Holding off on that discussion for later, Levi takes his squad out to assist in Hange's experiments on Eren's Titan abilities.[55]\n",
                "Eren participates in Hange's experiments without much success. He fails to show any signs of hardening, and upon a later transformation collapses in a smaller, malformed Titan body. Hange and Mikasa remove Eren from his Titan, and notice his disfigured face from where he had begun fusing to the body.[55]\n",
                "After spending a whole day resting, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin and expresses disappointment that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Soon after, Historia tells him that it must be nice to have a goal in mind, even if it is difficult to achieve, whereas she has no idea what she wants now that Ymir is gone. Eren is glad that Historia has started speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew is gone. Eren admits that he never liked her previous self, finding it forced and unnatural. He prefers her now that she is a normal, honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her talking to Bertholdt comes back to him.[55]\n",
                "After hearing of Pastor Nick's murder, Levi reads a message from Erwin and orders everybody out of the cabin. Outside, Levi reveals that the government is freezing all Scout Regiment activity outside the Walls and demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Before heading for Trost, Eren hands Hange a message detailing the conversation he had remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.[55]\n",
                "Eren rides alongside Historia in an enclosed wagon driven by Keiji, while Levi runs a decoy strategy with Jean and Armin posing as the two.[55] The wagon is attacked by members of the Military Police, who manage to tear the roof from the wagon using their mobility gear. Eren picks up a musket to fire on the attackers, but is tranquilized alongside Historia. Despite an effort from Levi Squad to recover them, the two are ultimately kidnapped successfully.[56]\n",
                "Eren awakes in a large crystalline cavern, gagged and restrained by chains atop a raised platform. As he struggles to break free, he spots Historia approaching below him.[57] He is glad to see she is safe and Historia assures him that her father has been misunderstood, having only acted in ways that are beneficial for humanity. Eren finds the cavern they are in familiar and Rod suggests that he and Historia lay their hands on Eren's back to help him remember. When they do, Eren begins seeing his father Grisha's memories and is stunned to learn that he ate his own father.[25]\n",
                "Once the three of them are alone, Rod opens a satchel and reveals a syringe, which Eren recognizes as the same kind his father had used on him. Rod explains that the Founding Titan's powers can only be fully utilized by a member of the Reiss family. Kenny, overhearing Rod's words as he returns, is distraught to learn he will not be able to use Frieda's power if he devours Eren. Intending to force Eren and Historia to battle each other over possession of Frieda's power, Kenny cuts open Eren's forehead so that he will be able to transform, before retreating to a safe distance.\n",
                "However, Eren refuses to transform. Heartbroken to learn that Frieda could have put an end to the Titans and prevented so many of the deaths that had occurred since the fall of Wall Maria, Eren begs Historia to eat him so that she can use the power that his father stole to save humanity. Moved by Eren's words, Historia incapacitates her father and begins freeing Eren from the restraints that still hold him, to Eren's shock and despair.[58]\n",
                "As Rod transforms himself into a Titan, Eren begs Historia to allow her father to eat him. Historia refuses, explaining that even if she is an enemy to humanity, she is still Eren's friend. She is blown back by the winds created from Rod's transformation, but Levi and his squad arrive in time to save her and get the keys to Eren's chains. The ceiling begins caving in due to the sheer size of Rod's Titan and the squad's escape is blocked. Eren realizes that everyone with him is going to die.\n",
                "As the squad considers ways to escape, Eren apologizes for being useless and Levi tells him that he has a choice to make. Spurred by Levi's words, Eren grabs a bottle labeled \"Armor\" that had fallen out of Rod's satchel and bites into it. After transforming into a Titan, Eren is able to harden it and reinforce the structural integrity of the cavern around it.\n",
                "The squad climbs out of the ruined cavern and regroups to chase after Rod, who has become an Abnormal Titan twice the size of the Colossal Titan. Eren still considers being eaten by Rod to save humanity but Historia argues that the Reiss family has already tried undoing the brainwashing and once Rod has the Founding Titan's power, he can alter everyone's memories so they have no interest in restraining him.\n",
                "Historia argues that taking away the Reiss family's ability to alter memories was the only way to save humanity, prompting Eren to remember his father's words from right before he injected him. His father asked him to learn to control this power to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else. They meet up with Erwin and his forces, and the Scouts all proceed to Orvud District to intercept Rod's Titan.[59] While en route, Eren screams at Rod and punches the air in a vain attempt to activate the Founding Titan and control the giant Titan the same way he had controlled the other Pure Titans.[60]\n",
                "Eren helps the scouts stack barrels of gunpowder together on a net of rope. He watches Historia stand up to Erwin and admires how strong she has become compared to him. Feeling melancholy that humanity has to depend on someone like him, he spots children in Orvud who remind him of himself as a child and thinks back to when the Colossal Titan first appeared. Armin tells him that it will be different from before, because this time the soldiers on the Wall can fight back. Eren punches himself, to try beating out his feelings of uselessness.\n",
                "When Rod's Titan arrives and pulls itself up to the Wall, Eren transforms into his Titan form. He takes the net stuffed with barrels and shoves it into the open mouth of the Titan, which is hot enough to make the gunpowder ignite. This causes the Titan's head and neck to explode and enables the scouts to attack the flying chunks of meat in hope of destroying the nape.[60]\n",
                "After Historia is crowned as the new queen, Eren tries to talk her down as she goes to punch Levi. Historia refuses to back down and punches Levi, but Eren and his comrades are all surprised when Levi reacts by smiling and thanking them.[22]\n",
                "Two months after Historia becomes queen, Eren and the other members of the 104th volunteer at an orphanage that she has started. As Eren helps Historia, she asks about the progress of his hardening experiments. Eren says they are going well, but wants to speed up the training before Reiner and Bertholdt come back. She asks what he would do if they meet up again, and Eren says he will have to kill them. Eren compliments Historia for the work she has done, prompting Mikasa to abruptly interrupt the conversation and take Eren's load away from him.\n",
                "Thanks to Eren's hardening experiments, a Titan guillotine is developed, giving soldiers a reusable weapon to safely kill Titans without risking their lives. However, creating the materials for one puts a strain on Eren's body.\n",
                "As Eren and his friends eat dinner in the mess hall, Eren recalls Ymir's claim that her life was like a nightmare when she was a Titan outside of the Walls. He wonders if there was a time when he was like that too, but all he remembers is what his father saw when Eren ate him. Jean jokes that a headbutt from their commandant would bring the memory back and Eren realizes that the man his father had seen before his death was Commandant Keith Sadies.\n",
                "The next morning, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Hange and Sasha visit Keith. Eren asks him to tell them all that he knows and Keith tells him how he met Grisha and everything he knows about him. Keith confesses that he is nothing more than a bystander and that he has no power to change things.[15]\n",
                "The day before the operation to retake Wall Maria, the soldiers have a feast in celebration. As Eren and Conny restrain Sasha to keep her from eating everything, the two reflect on how much things have changed in three months since the battle of Trost. Jean starts a fight with Eren by insulting him and their fight is eventually stopped by Levi.\n",
                "After the fight, Eren, Armin and Mikasa have a conversation about their future. They talk about how strong and weak people need to combine their abilities in order to succeed. After mistaking a Garrison soldier with Hannes, Mikasa wonders if they will be able to go back to easier times when they retake Wall Maria. Eren answers that it may not be possible, but that is the reason why they must make them pay.\n",
                "The next morning, the soldiers are ready to depart on their mission. They become very surprised when they see that the civilians are cheering them. Finally, Erwin orders the start of the operation and Eren travels towards Shiganshina along with Squad Levi.[61]\n",
                "Eren stands atop the Wall with Mikasa and Armin, as a guillotine-like device crushes the head of a Titan below. Mikasa thinks back at a time and place with the two, where they reminisced about the old days before the fall of Wall Maria.[62]\n",
                "While traveling on foot under the cover of night, Eren apologizes to Mikasa, who is escorting his horse in addition to her own, but she insists that he save his energy so that he can seal Wall Maria. Eren is surprised to find himself shaking in anticipation. He insists that he is just shaking from the cold, but Armin reassures him that it is normal to feel scared of the Titans and reminds Eren of when he was nearly eaten during the Battle for Trost. Eren reveals that he sacrificed himself to save Armin that day because he had remembered the first time Armin told him about the outside world, which had caused him to realize just how much the Titans had taken from the humans.\n",
                "Arriving in Shiganshina, the Scouts quickly scale Wall Maria with their ODM gear. Soaring over Wall Maria, Eren transforms into his Titan form and uses his hardening abilities to seal its hole. Mikasa retrieves him and carries him back to the top of the Wall.\n",
                "While going to meet up with the rest of Scouts, Hange orders Eren's squad to take up positions along the top of the Wall after observing a signal flare fired by Erwin. To Eren's shock, Reiner emerges from the inside of the Wall and kill a Scout before being attacked by Levi. As Reiner transforms into his Titan form, Eren is surprised again by the sudden appearance of an army of Titans on the outskirts of Shiganshina, with the Beast Titan leading them.[63]\n",
                "On Erwin's orders, Eren descends into Shiganshina where he changes into his Titan form and acts as bait to draw Reiner's attention. After leading Reiner away from Wall Maria, Eren begins to engage him, using his new hardening abilities to cover his fists in armor. Although he initially has the upper hand against Reiner, Eren is momentarily overpowered and pinned to the ground. He manages to regain control of the fight and throw Reiner off of him, and into an area where Hange's squad can attack. As Eren watches, Hange's squad blinds Reiner with their Thunder Spears before blowing open his Titan form's nape and apparently killing him.[64]\n",
                "After being informed that Bertholdt is approaching, Hange orders Eren and his comrades to retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity to avoid the blast from Bertholdt's transformation. After Armin fails to negotiate with Bertholdt, Bertholdt transforms into his Titan form and Eren uses his Titan form to shield his comrades from the blast.[65] Armin gives control of the squad to Jean and Eren begins to retreat from Bertholdt's position on Jean's orders, using a nearby building to keep himself hidden.\n",
                "Eren attempts to draw Bertholdt's attention away from Wall Maria and the remaining Scouts. Bertholdt ignores him and Eren and his comrades are left with no choice but to engage him. As his comrades flank Bertholdt, Eren grabs one of Bertholdt's legs and attempts to push him back. Bertholdt simply kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, leaving him incapacitated.[66]\n",
                "After Armin wakes him up, Eren reluctantly goes along with Armin's plan, pretending to fall down to the ground and become immobile in front of the north gate while Armin pretends to act shocked. Escaping his Titan form after hardening it, Eren then grapples onto the nape of the Colossal Titan, slices it open, and yanks Bertholdt out. Once Bertholdt is incapacitated, Eren finds Armin's charred body.[67]\n",
                "Eren laments that he could not prevent Armin from being killed. He notices Zeke closing in on him and threatens to kill Bertholdt if Zeke comes any closer. To Eren's shock, Zeke claims that he has been enslaved by his father Grisha's ideology and promises to save him. Before Eren can question him Zeke retreats as Levi arrives. Noticing that Armin is still breathing, Eren begs Levi to use the Titan serum on him. Levi initially agrees before deciding to give it to Erwin upon learning that the commander is still alive. He tries reminding Levi of all that Armin accomplished as reasons that he should be spared. Levi ultimately chooses Armin. As Armin returns to his human form after devouring Bertholdt, Eren and the 104th reunite with him.[68]\n",
                "When Armin wakes up, Eren explains what has transpired to him, including Bertholdt's death. He, Hange, Levi, and Mikasa make their way to his basement. However, they discover that the key Grisha had given him does not fit the lock. Levi kicks down the door and they enter an office. It seems to be nondescript until Mikasa finds a keyhole in Grisha's desk. Eren tries the key on it and it opens to reveal a drawer that appears to be empty. They find a false bottom in the drawer and underneath it are preserved books. Eren, with Mikasa, opens one of them and finds a picture of a family. On the back of it is a message of Grisha that the picture is called a \"photograph\" and that humanity has not perished.[69]\n",
                "Upon returning victorious to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are placed in detention for disobeying orders from Levi and Hange.[70] While serving his sentence, he helps Armin verify the contents of Grisha's books regarding the outside world and the true nature of the Titans by comparing them with his memories that Grisha passed down to him. During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization that Dina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.\n",
                "After spending a short time in detention, Eren and Mikasa were released by Levi and Hange ten days early, who informed them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public, and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Scout Regiment after their losses at Shiganshina and in light of the new revelations about the outside world.\n",
                "Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren comes to the sudden realization that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[3]\n",
                "The surviving Scouts later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins, Floch Forster confronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins but before it can escalate it was broken apart by Jean. Armin, agreeing with Floch's argument, is comforted by Eren who reminds Armin of his dream to see the ocean.\n",
                "Eren contemplates the findings of the basement, whilst receiving his medal from Historia. When kissing her hand, he receives a memory from his father, desperately trying to reason with Freida Reiss as she becomes possessed by the First King's will. Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[71][41] Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[30]\n",
                "In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Scout Regiment holds its first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Scouts encounter a deformed Titan which has been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Scouts follow the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge of Paradis Island.\n",
                "The Scout Regiment go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Eren agrees with an overjoyed Armin that the ocean is big, but solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe. Enemies exist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[30]\n",
                "In the year 851, Eren works with Hange Zoë and the Scouts to prepare for Marleyan action against Paradis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses his Titan form to pick it up and beach it on the shoreline. At a meeting between members of the Eldian Military, Eren supports the plan made by Zeke Jaeger and reveals the encounter with Dina Fritz that caused him to activate the powers of the Founding Titan. He explains to Hange and Levi Ackermann that he stayed quiet so that Historia Reiss's life would not be threatened.\n",
                "Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island, all of which are destroyed by Eren and Armin Arlelt. While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything from Bertholdt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[72]\n",
                "A year later, Eren later attends a meeting between Kiyomi Azumabito, from the nation of Hizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Kiyomi Azumabito presents Zeke's plan to use the Founder to partially Rumble the outside world as a warning and pass the Titan on to Historia and her offspring so that they can continue to use it as leverage for the foreseeable future, Eren adamantly rejects it.\n",
                "In 853, while helping his friends build a train line, Eren is left crestfallen when Hange and Levi arrive with news that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. As the group returns home after finishing their work, Eren reminds his friends that he only has a few years left to live. Eren ponders who should inherit his Titan and his friends begin offering themselves. Eren, however, insists that his Titan will not go to any of them as he wants them to live long lives.[39]\n",
                "Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost. Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own. Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.\n",
                "Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crush Global Allied Fleet as well as Fort Salta.\n",
                "Later, Eren meets with Historia and warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.\n",
                "She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan.\n",
                "Eren is one of several Scouts who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.\n",
                "Shortly after arriving on the mainland, the Scouts encounter a boy who has been caught pickpocketing and save him from a public lynching. Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. Remembering Karl Fritz's desire for the Eldian people to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate.\n",
                "He finds the same would-be pickpocket being beaten by merchants for stealing and realizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in the Rumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening.\n",
                "Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. Before he parts ways with the boy, Eren breaks down and tearfully apologizes to him for the atrocities which he knows he will soon commit.[73]\n",
                "The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached.\n",
                "Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Conny and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.\n",

After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up by Falco Grice who points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[74]\n",

He admits to the boy that he is faking his psychological issues, claiming that he does not want to go home. Eren deduces that he has been training to inherit one of the Nine Titans. Falco laments that he likely will not score high enough to inherit a Titan, but Eren argues that Falco deserves to live a long life and not inherit the Curse of Ymir. Falco reveals that he wants to inherit the Titan to spare his friend's life, prompting Eren to begin pondering his experiences in Marley.\n",
                "Noting the crippled and mentally broken soldiers around him in the hospital, Eren muses to Falco that the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of them and that anyone able to throw themselves into war must be able to see something beyond it, be it another hell or another hope, that keeps them motivated to move forward.[23]\n",
                "Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who begins delivering letters for him. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior. After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself as Jaeger. The two talk about Falco, and Jaeger asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to the Grice family. Eren asks Jaeger if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.\n",

Eren waits in the basement of a building near the stage on which Willy Tybur is set to perform and Falco brings Reiner to him.[8] Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.\n",

Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the \"bad guy,\" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.\n",

Transforming into the Attack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building, killing many from the debris, and crushes Willy and devours him.[7] He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, the War Hammer Titan emerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the incoming cannon shots as well as the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away. Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Scout Regiment attacks the Marleyan military.\n",
                "The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it. As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren recalls that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than the nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan's foot. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body of Lara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer Titan.\n",

With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee.[9] Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin. Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again. The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren, and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara's crystal. Noticing that the strike successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to get to Lara by using the Jaw Titan.\n",
                "Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren to grab it and disable it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan. He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan.[10] Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan and states that he does not have enough energy left to finish off Reiner, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.\n",
                "Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong. Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha. Hange berates Eren for having forced the Scouts to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Conny comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was \"meat,\" Eren breaks into a laugh.[40]\n",
                "After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[72]\n",
                "Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange has visited him for and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[39]\n",
                "At roughly the same time Dhalis Zachary is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. After escaping, Eren meets up with the Jaegerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[75]\n",
                "Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pyxis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns from one of his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi. Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully.[76] Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire. Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her.\n",
                "Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertholdt had of her. When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermanns, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.\n",
                "Armin attacks Eren, but Mikasa suddenly grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission. He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[77]\n",
                "Eren visits Gabi in her holding cell and offers to help her save Falco in exchange for her issuing a call for help to Marley to root out any possible spies. Eren is caught by surprise when one of his soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat. He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him. Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Jaegerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.\n",
                "On the roof, he prepares to injure himself again and orders Pieck to reveal her fellow infiltrators. She points at Eren himself, and the Jaw Titan suddenly attacks Eren, taking both of his legs. Transforming, Eren spots a fleet of Marleyan airships approaching their location.[78] Eren trades several blows with the Jaw Titan before it retreats. Eren is perplexed at Marley's decision to launch a counterattack so soon after the raid on Liberio.\n",
                "Despite Yelena pleading with him to flee underground, Eren decides to fight Marley on his own. Noticing Reiner transforming into the Armored Titan while parachuting from an airship, Eren deduces that was responsible for Marley's quick response to the Liberio attack and the two proceed to engage each other.\n",
                "Eren initially overpowers Reiner, using his superior fighting skills and hardening to break through Reiner's armor plating. Reiner manages to briefly stun Eren and the Jaw Titan attempts to ambush him from behind but Eren uses the War Hammer Titan's abilities to repel them.\n",
                "Eren is shot in the head with a round from Marley's anti-Titan artillery, leaving his motor skills severely impaired. Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time. Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground.[79] Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.\n",
                "With Zeke's arrival, Eren begins trying to reach him in hopes of activating the powers of the Founding Titan while Zeke keeps Marley's Warriors at bay.[80] Eren is set upon by the Jaw Titan once again but makes short work of him, repeatedly slamming down on the Titan's head and nape. However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him. The fighting is momentarily interrupted by the arrival of Colt and Falco who reveal that Falco has accidentally ingested Zeke's spinal fluid.\n",
                "Zeke is undeterred and screams, ordering a transformed Falco to attack Reiner. Falco's Pure Titan does not prove to be enough to force Reiner to let go of Eren, so Eren exits his Titan and begins running to Zeke on foot. However, before he can reach his brother Eren is decapitated by a blast from an anti-Titan artillery rifle.\n",
                "As his head lands in his brother's hand, Eren suddenly finds himself standing before a pillar of light in an unknown land. He is greeted by a chained Zeke, who informs Eren that they are standing in the Coordinate. Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die.\n",
                "Eren notices a young girl approaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.\n",
                "Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored. To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha. Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[81]\n",
                "Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.\n",
                "As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own. Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment.\n",
                "Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors. Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. Enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Fay to spur him into attacking the family.[82]\n",
                "Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.\n",
                "He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.\n",
                "In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble. He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir. He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that the Wall Titans will destroy all life outside the island.[71]\n",
                "Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossal Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery on Marley is also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[32]\n",
                "While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with them in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Conny's mother, to return to their human forms.\n",
                "When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Eren asks Armin to follow him.\n",
                "Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the \"liquid fire\" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir.\n",
                "As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertholdt, which lead her to eat his mother.\n",
                "Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done.\n",
                "As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren reveals that he will succeed in wiping out 80% of the world's population before being stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to get Eren to understand that he has not actually killed these people yet, so he can still make a choice, but Eren explains that no matter how hard he tried, everything always occurred exactly as he saw in his memories of the future. Armin refuses to accept this. Unmoved, Eren says he always wanted to level everything like this. He thought he was doing this to protect those he cared about, but people like Sasha Braus and Hange Zoë died because of him, and he kept setting his friends up for lethal confrontations with Floch Forster. \n",
                "As he looks at bits of hair and gore he picked out of the blood water, Eren thinks he finally knows why everything turned out this way, and it is because he is an idiot who obtained an immense power. Armin picks something out of the blood water and says he understands wanting to erase some people out of the world. Eren calls him a liar, but undeterred, Armin says he was the one who put the idea of a free world in Eren's head.\n",
                "The object Armin picked up was the seashell from when they first saw the sea. He hands it to Eren and thanks him for showing him what was beyond the Walls. He emphasizes that the two of them are responsible, so they will always be together in hell. Eren is touched that their friendship remains unbroken, but tells Armin that he will erase the memory of this conversation until after everything is over.[41]\n",
                "As he approaches Fort Salta Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans.\n",
                "However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.\n",
                "Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[73]\n",
                "As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him. Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.\n",
                "This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossal form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossal Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.\n",
                "In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.\n",
                "Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[41]\n\n",
                "In the year 844, Eren accompanies his father, Dr. Jaeger, to the Ackermanns during a medical visit. He is introduced to Mikasa and the two begin wandering the forest nearby. Eren tells Mikasa that he heard her mother is pregnant, to which she confirms and says her mother believes it to be a boy. Eren remarks that if the child is a boy, he hopes that he will become a soldier. He reveals to Mikasa his dream of joining the Scout Regiment and exploring the outside world.\n",
                "Suddenly, the two hear howling in the distance. Mikasa becomes worried, saying that her father does not want her going deep into the forest, but Eren runs ahead on his own to investigate, prompting Mikasa to follow him. The two come across the ruins of a campsite overrun by rabid dogs that have killed a trio of travelers. The dogs spot Eren and Mikasa, then slowly approach them, but suddenly turn their tracks and leave. The two return home and inform their parents of the location of the corpses they saw.\n",
                "Over the course of Dr. Jaeger's visits, Eren continues playing with Mikasa and the two quickly become friends. He tells her of his friend, Armin, who is intelligent and reads a lot of books, and is also the one who told him about the outside world. Eren mentions that they will one day explore the outside world together. During the next visit, he arrives with many injuries to his face. Eren talks to Mikasa about the outside world and describes the ocean as being a large amount of salt water that is big enough to the point merchants could never sell all of its salt.\n",
                "He continues that the outside world also has fiery water, lands of ice, and land all covered in sand. Mentioning that the people who fought him are cowards who are content with living ignorant within the Walls, Eren reiterates his dream of joining the Scout Regiment to see the outside world.\n",
                "When Mikasa is sent to Shiganshina District, Eren meets her upon arriving. Hearing the bell that signals the return of the Scout Regiment from an exterior scouting mission, Eren eagerly heads to see the Scouts, which return in shambles.\n",
                "In front of them, two civilians comment on the scene, saying their taxes are being wasted on feeding the Titans. Eren strikes one of them in anger, and the man takes Eren into a nearby alley. The man begins to mercilessly beat Eren as Mikasa watches in shock. That night, Eren is taken to his home and his wounds are treated.\n",
                "Eren stops going to Mikasa's house for sometime, and when the Ackermanns move into Shiganshina to be closer to Dr. Jaeger, Mikasa questions Eren on why he stopped visiting her. Eren tells her that the Scout Regiment has been disbanded for the lack of results, and the gate leading to the outside of the Wall has been sealed off.\n",
                "Mikasa is relieved that Eren will not be able to leave the Walls, but he adds that he will be leaving with Armin using a hot air balloon they were building, and it is why he could not visit her. Mikasa asks Eren to take her with him, and he responds by wrapping his scarf around her and mentioning a path to a nearby forest, telling her that she can return it to him there in three days. At the time of their leaving, the balloon fails to gain enough altitude and Eren pushes Armin to safety, before it crashed into the Wall.[62]\n",
                "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat.[29] While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.[4]\n",
                "At first, it is shown that Eren was not very skilled with the ODM gear. During the initial balancing tests, he kept tripping and smacking his head on the floor. People mocked him for this. Eren pleaded for help from everyone but the only advice they could give Eren was that he needed to clear his mind and focus. On his last attempt, Eren did just that and stayed upright for a short period of time before tipping over and hitting his head. Seeing this, the commandant, Keith Sadies told Thomas Wagner to swap equipment with Eren and for Eren to try again. Eren did so and balanced with ease. The commandant then told Eren that his equipment was damaged and that it was a miracle that he managed to stay upright at all.[29]\n",
                "Eren was not shown using the gear as much as other members of the Scout Regiment, but he was able to hold his own against the Colossal Titan for a short period of time when it reappeared for the first time in five years.[1] He was also capable of killing a Titan on his own.[20] His most significant use of the ODM gear was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertholdt Hoover out of the Colossal Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being clearly exhausted.[67]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected Eren with a Titan injection, which transformed him into a Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a stocky body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.\n",
                "During the first Battle of Trost, Eren was swallowed whole by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. This sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into a Titan. In this form, he was a 15-meter-tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, Eren's Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerts himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",
                "Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and is able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It has been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation.[35]\n",
                "Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, had to physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibited his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. From his suppressed memories, Eren believed that the full truth of his Titan powers, as well as a way to defeat the Titans once and for all, was located in the basement beneath the ruins of his family home.\n",
                "Named the \"Coordinate\" by Bertholdt Hoover and Reiner Braun, the Founding Titan was given to Eren when his father Grisha stole it from the Reiss family. It possessed the power to control Pure Titans.[54] However, this ability could only be used while Eren was in contact with a Titan of royal blood.\n",
                "Eren first used this ability entirely by accident by punching the Smiling Titan, who was in fact a royal-blooded human turned Titan. This commanded the nearby Titans to viciously attack and consume the Smiling Titan, as well as attacking Reiner and Bertholdt. While it was shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it was possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans. \n",
                "Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups have expressed an interest in Eren, being sought after by Marley's Warriors, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family.\n",
                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\"[83]. With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[71]\n",

                "Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan is one of the best-selling manga series in history, with over 140 million copies sold to date. Fortunately, the anime adaptation of the manga series enjoys the same popularity for its dystopian future and profound character arcs. Eren Yeager is the main protagonist of Attack on Titan and perhaps the series' most complex character. His character growth and the shift from an eager young man to an anti-hero who shapes the future are outstanding, albeit devastating for the world.",
                "Eren's childhood trauma, combined with what he faces in the field against the Titans, plays an undeniable role in his resilient personality. The events of Attack on Titan's final season show Eren Yeager is in possession of three Titans. He gained the Founding and Attack Titans from his father, while he came in possession of the War Hammer Titan after consuming Lara Tybur. Each Titan has its own abilities, especially the Founding Titan, who is practically a god-like figure in Isayama's dark fantasy world.",
                "Updated on February 7, 2024, by Ajay Aravind: Attack on Titan isn't for the faint of heart. The sheer violence engendered by Eren after he activated the Rumbling is an apocalyptic nightmare. That said, the world would have probably been a safer place had it not been for the Founding Titan. As such, we've updated this article with some more relevant information. ",
                "From Levi Ackerman to Eren Yeager, several Attack on Titan characters transformed and became the strongest in the end.",
                " The history of the Founding Titans is filled with blood and political backstabbing and dates back as far as two thousand years. It all started with Ymir Fritz, a slave fleeing the atrocities of the Eldians. In her attempt to escape from being hunted down like an animal as punishment, she comes across a strange tree with an opening. Trying to hide, she fell into an underground water cave and came across an unknown alien-like creature with a spine. Ymir bonded with the creature and transformed into the first Titan.",
                "Ymir came out of the tree bestowed with incredible abilities, and that's when King Fritz developed the plan to exploit her powers by marrying her. She bore three children for the king, and the true power of the Founding Titan was passed down to the Fritz dynasty. According to lore, even when Ymir died, the power of the Titans lived on through the Nine Titans as they are essentially fragments of her soul. She can pass down those fragments by her will, but she is the only true Titan who can wield all powers. However, after her death, the Nine Titans used their powers to conquer the kingdom known as Marley.",
                "As time went by, the Marleyans fought back, seized seven of the nine Titans, and drove most of the Eldians out. The 145th King, Karl Fritz, who was heartbroken by the misdeeds of his people, sent numerous Eldians to Paradis Island and built solid walls around it. Karl Fritz later conspired with the Tybur family to incite the Great Titan War. Only the Tybur and the Reiss family remained as the last Eldian households with their Titans. In the year 845, Grisha Yeager took Frieda Reiss's Founding Titan and, thus, began the story of Eren Yeager.",
                "The best-written characters in Attack on Titan have arcs that completely transform them, for better or worse.",
                " Eren Yeager always had a strong sense of purpose, and that was even before he turned into a Titan. The was always left with burning questions about why Eren was chosen and what made him special. Eren inherited his Titan power from his father, but more specifically, he transformed into a Pure Titan because his father injected him with a Titan Serum. However, not just anyone can inject themselves with the serum and use the Titan's powers.",
                "This privilege is only bestowed upon the descendants of Ymir, and the Yeagers were one of Ymir's subjects. When Eren was injected with the serum, he became a Pure Titan – a creature that needs to consume another human being to obtain the Titan's power. Eren ate his father Grisha and became the most powerful Titan in the world by consuming the abilities of both the Attack and Founding Titans.",
                "A Palworld player has faithfully recreated the world of Attack on Titan within the monster-catching survival game being dubbed \"Pokémon with guns.\"",
                " Eren's Titan form is the most ferocious and powerful of all, and that's thanks to him gaining full access after he convinces the soul of Ymir Fritz to give him power. Eren's Founding Titan has a physically different appearance than the rest, and it's by far one of the largest Titans in the series. The viewers also noticed that Eren's Titan has a strange skeletal body – more like a monstrous spine, and there's a reason why it's like that. When Eren gained the Founding Titan, he had already been decapitated, and through self-preservation, the Founding Titan connected Eren's head back via the spine.",
                "However, since the head was far away from the body, the spine started to grow uncontrollably during the connection – resulting in a Titan form that had a large spine-like structure and looked more like a monster than a humanoid. Most Titans' bodies are a manifestation of their human counterparts. But in Eren's case, the spine played the basis for the transformation because of the severed head, making Eren's Founding Titan more like a collection of bones with a spinal cage.",
                "The Founding Titan possesses several destructive abilities demonstrated by each possessor according to their will. But for Eren, the scale of his powers surpasses any of his predecessors as he holds three Titans within his body.",
                "Before Eren, King Karl used this ability to control an army of 50-meter Colossal Titans to build the three walls surrounding Paradis. He commanded them to harden their bodies and enclose the remaining Eldians within the structures. Eren used Titan Control to influence all the Titans for his fight against Dina Fritz. That said, he doesn't use this power very often. By the end of the story, Eren commanded the Colossal Titans to emerge from the walls and begin marching around the world.",
                "The Founding Titan has the ability to telepathically connect with all the Subjects of Ymir, wherever they may be. The Founding Titan does that through the connection of the Paths, a series of mysterious channels that only the Eldians can access. In fact, the Founding Titan can talk to every Eldian in every corner of the world and even experience everything they're going through. Eren already showcased this ability when he announced his plans to every Titan and Eldian in the world for the upcoming Rumbling.",
                "This uncanny ability enables the Founding Titan to turn any Eldian into a Titan, and it doesn't even require its spinal fluid for the process. King Karl demonstrated this ability when he created an army of Colossus Titans and turned them into a gigantic wall. Even though Eren specifically didn't \"create\" any Titans, he used the Founding Titan's powers to release the Wall Titans for his plan. He then created a Titan body of his own that's unfathomably large, exponentially bigger than the Colossus Titan.",
                "No anime has been able to pull off shocking revelations and mind-bending plot twists as impressively as Attack on Titan. ",
                " An Eldian King used this ability 600 years ago to make the Subjects of Ymir immune to an epidemic. The Founding Titan can manipulate the body composition of any Subject of Ymir, just like how Zeke wanted to strip the Eldians of the ability to give birth. It was part of his grand scheme of freeing any future Eldian from the curse of the bloodline. If this plan had succeeded, then the world would have lost every Eldian after a few decades. To most people, this sounds like a better alternative than allowing 80% of the world's population to die in horrific ways.",
                "Clairvoyance is the Founding Titan's ability to access time — past, present, and future all at the same time. Eren uses this ability to talk to Armin in the realm of the Paths. He admits to him that he used this ability to influence Dina Fritz's Pure Titan, but it indirectly caused his mother's death. This confirms the limitation of this ability, as it only allows the user to manipulate past events in order to preserve history, not change it. As a result, the user has no choice but to go along with the events that they've witnessed, even if they don't want them to happen.",
                "The Rumbling is actually not an ability, but an indication of the end of days. King Karl spread the rumor when he enclosed his people on Paradis Island that if anyone disturbs their peace, he'll unleash the wrath of the Titans. Ironically, in the final episodes of Attack on Titan, Eren indeed unleashed the Rumbling by freeing the Colossus Titans from the walls of the island. Traumatized and eventually angered by the atrocities caused by the Marley, Eren set out to do the unspeakable and with a Titan form like no other. He wanted to destroy the world and anyone in pursuit of hurting the Eldians, and would have fulfilled his macabre mission if not for his friends. The final part of Attack on Titan Season 4 aired in November 2023, concluding the worldwide phenomenon of Hajime's dark saga.",

                "Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.[33] This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.[34]\n",
                "Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria.[35] He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.[35]\n",
                "In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best,[36] and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.[37]\n",
                "After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.[38]\n",
                "Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans.[39] After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[8]\n",
                "Eren shortly before graduating the 104th Training Corps",
                "Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[40] After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.\n",
                "Eren was first seen wearing typical townsfolk attire that consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a reddish-brown coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a black scarf, which he gave to Mikasa Ackerman the day they met. As a teenager, he was often seen in the typical Survey Corps uniform while training. His casual attire consisted of a long beige shirt identical to the one he wore in his first appearance, a maroon sash around his waist, white trousers, and brown knee-high boots. He always kept the key given to him by his father dangling around his neck on a string.[41]\n",
                "By the time Eren infiltrates Marley in the year 854, Eren had grown visibly taller, and his hair has grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that cover his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[42] After returning to Paradis Island, Eren discarded his Survey Corps attire and began wearing a white shirt with dark pants underneath a simple black mantle.[43] He tied his hair back into a bun and shaved off his mustache and goatee.[44]\n",
                "Eren as a Titan",
                "Eren's appearance changes quite drastically when he transformed into the Attack Titan. His height increased to 15 m, his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, and his tongue and ears became elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation; he developed a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes became deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that was unsuited for intelligible speech. Despite this, he was capable of howling and roaring in order to express his exhaustion and anger. In addition, he also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, so his teeth were exposed.\n",
                "Similarly to past Attack Titan holders, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, and muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearances of regular Titans.[45]\n",
                "Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed Doomsday Titan[46] (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?)[9], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. Initially, much of the Titan was shrouded by the steam from the Wall Titans, but its sheer size was immediately noted, towering over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extended far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan. [47]\n",
                "The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the \"ribcage\" (although it was revealed that the \"ribcage\" arose from the lower back). The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge. Inside the Titan, Eren's head was disconnected from his torso; having been decapitated and rejoined by Ymir's power, it was connected by additional vertebrae to what presumably was his body. Some sinew supports his scalp.\n",
                "The Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the Rumbling.[48]\n",
                "Eren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It was 4 m[12] tall with short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. His Pure Titan form also had a big head, elongated ears, and an overall stocky build.\n",
                "Eren expresses his desire to kill the Titans",
                "Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which are attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and, eventually, his equally strong determination to escape the Walls. Even as a young child, he was so intent on joining the Survey Corps that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and comparing them to complacent livestock.[49]\n",
                "Eren cared deeply for his friends and family, risking harm and even death in order to protect them. As a child, he took on larger boys who bullied Armin Arlert and, more tragically, he attempted to lift the rubble that crushed his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[50] Eren was also capable of displaying violent behavior in defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he attempted to rescue Mikasa Ackerman by brutally slaughtering two of the human traffickers who had captured her.[51]\n",
                "After Armin showed Eren a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, he grew to share his friend's curiosity of the world beyond the Walls and decided to see it for himself.[52] This led Eren to develop a scornful attitude towards anyone who was content to live and die within the Walls' confines without ever setting foot outside. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Survey Corps, regarding them as \"heroes\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He was quick to take offense when anyone spoke badly of the Corps, and his determination to join them caused friction between himself, his mother, and to a lesser extent, Mikasa.[53]\n",
                "Eren has a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing his friends and family to worry about him.[54] His limited self-control was evident in his temper, which often caused him to act recklessly in anger, or say things he himself knew he should not have. This was exacerbated by his tendency to view the world in terms of black and white, where individuals who deny others their freedom were worthless scum, unfit to be left alive.[55] Though he had great compassion, Eren had little in the way of empathy and was prone to taking things at face value, evaluating situations or ideas solely by his own arbitrary perspective and rarely ever thought deeper about them unless someone else pointed things out for him.[56]\n",
                "Though Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities. He was often ready to blame himself and his incompetence whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This was most evident when he blamed himself for the death of the Special Operations Squad at the hands of the Female Titan, and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover.\n",
                "Eren asks Historia to eat him and save humanity",
                "Eren's ordeals since the coup d'état have mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about where his father had been the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity.[57] He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n",
                "By the time he found out from his father's books that Titans were actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan an \"Eldian.\"[58]\n",
                "Eren possesses great amounts of perseverance, fortitude, and determination. As such, he managed to master the basics of vertical maneuvering equipment, even when his equipment was damaged,[59] and graduate as fifth top trainee in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[60]\n",
                "Eren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirstein, his bitter rival, had admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Survey Corps before the Battle of Trost.[61] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifted Falco's spirits and convinced him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians were usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[62]\n",
                "Eren figures out the true location of the War Hammer Titan",
                "In the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Survey Corps, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[63] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[64] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[65]\n",
                "Eren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[66]\n",
                "His infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom,[67] regardless of how many lives were lost on either side. Furthermore, this personal mission had driven him enough that he unleashed all of the Wall Titans and declared he will trample the entire world to exterminate all life outside of the island.[68]\n",
                "Eren collapses a building with Eldian families inside",
                "Eren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[69]\n",
                "In spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[70] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n",
                "Eren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[71] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[72] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Blouse's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirstein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria.[73]\n",
                "It was later revealed that Eren knew the future via the Attack Titan's ability and had been spiraling down a state of depression realizing he would eventually enact the Rumbling, and knowing what the inevitable outcome of the present would be. While he did wish for a peaceful solution, he understood the impossibility of it better than all around him, even Armin.\n",
                "After initiating the Rumbling, Eren had intended for the world to see the Eldians who stopped him as heroes. However, he was still unsure if his friends could have really stopped him, noting he would have completed the Rumbling if they did not. Eren could not pinpoint the reason he wanted to wipe out the world, recalling Grisha telling him \"you are free\" the day he was born. In a rare display of emotions since years, Eren broke down to Armin at the thought of Mikasa finding someone else after his death, and revealed his true feelings about her, causing Armin to pity him. Eren desired to be with Mikasa and everyone else, but knew he could not be forgiven for his actions after wiping out 80% of the world's population.[74]\n",
                "Carla held a baby Eren",
                "Eren was born in Shiganshina District on March 30th, 835, in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla Yeager and Grisha Yeager.[75] During his childhood he encountered a crying Armin Arlert, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies.[76] Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world. Eren dreamed of joining the Survey Corps as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were frequently regarded as heretics and harassed constantly by other children.\n",
                "When Eren was nine years old he accompanied his father on a house call to the Ackerman family's house only to find both parents murdered and their daughter Mikasa missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Yeager instructed Eren to stay within the house while he fetched the Military Police. Eren, however, tracked the the robbers to a small cabin in the forest behind the house.[77]\n",
                "Eren saved Mikasa from the robbers",
                "Thinking quickly, Eren feigned distress and claimed that he was lost. As one of the robbers approached Eren, he pulled out a hidden knife and stabbed the man. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on.\n",
                "As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by a third robber, who proceeded to strangle him. Eren urged Mikasa, who was frozen in fear, to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him.\n",
                "Eren gave Mikasa his scarf",
                "When Dr. Yeager eventually returned with the MPs, he took Eren aside, scolding him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the robbers. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Yeager invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[78]\n",
                "Grisha promises to show Eren the basement",
                "After Eren is woken from a nightmare by Mikasa, the two walk home through Shiganshina. They are greeted by Hannes, who begins teasing Eren for having apparently cried in his sleep. Eren is annoyed to see that Hannes and his friends are slacking off on the job and refuses to be placated by their claims that the Titans will never breach Wall Maria.[79] Leaving Hannes behind, the children stop again to watch the Survey Corps return from an expedition and Eren is crestfallen to see that the Corps has returned defeated.\n",
                "Upon returning home, Mikasa reveals to Eren's mother that he wants to join the Survey Corps. Carla forbids him from joining due to the Corps' high mortality rate and begs Grisha to talk some sense into his son. Grisha ignores her objections and instead announces that he will be leaving for a few days on a trip, promising Eren that when he gets back he will show the boy what he has hidden in the basement of their home. Enthralled, Eren joins his mother and Mikasa in waving him off. Carla reminds him that she will not allow him to join the Survey Corps, and they exchange a heated argument before he runs off.[80]\n",
                "Eren, Mikasa, and Armin see the Colossus Titan",
                "Eren and Mikasa scare off bullies harassing Armin and the three stroll through Shiganshina and settle by the riverbank. Armin deduces that Eren's parents found out he wants to join the Survey Corps before criticizing the widespread belief that it is impossible for the Titans to breach the Walls.[81] Suddenly lightning strikes, and an earthquake breaks out. The three gather in the center of the district with other civilians, where they all gawk in horror at the sight of a Titan larger than Wall Maria. The Titan kicks a hole through Wall Maria's gate, sending massive pieces of debris throughout the town.[82]\n",
                "Eren watches in horror as his mother is eaten by a Titan",
                "Eren and Mikasa hurry home as Titans begin entering the district, arriving to find their house crushed by a large rock and his mother trapped beneath the rubble. As Eren tries to help her, a Titan begins approaching the collapsed house. Hannes arrives, intending to fight off the Titan, but is overcome by fear. Rather than fight the Titan, he takes Eren and Mikasa to safety and abandons Carla.[83]\n",
                "Hannes leaves Eren and Mikasa on a boat leaving the Titan-infested city. There, Eren and Mikasa witness an Armored Titan destroying the back gate of Shiganshina. As Eren realizes that he can never return home, he vows to kill every Titan in existence.[84]\n",
                "Eren, along with Mikasa and Armin, are sent to a shelter for refugees from Wall Maria. Soon after, Grisha arrives and finds Eren, who tells him that his mother was eaten.[85] After hearing this, Grisha takes Eren into a nearby forest and instructs him to go to the basement; before Eren can react, Grisha injects him with a Titan serum, turning Eren into a mindless Titan. Eren instinctively eats his father, receiving his Titan powers, including the dormant Founding Titan.[86]\n",
                "After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin briefly worked on a farm with other survivors of Wall Maria before reaching the proper age to enroll in the Military two years later.[87] During the 104th's rite of passage conducted by instructor Keith Shadis, Eren is ignored alongside others who have clearly experienced trauma in their past.[88]\n",
                "Eren fights with Jean",
                "Before training, Eren draws a crowd of trainees at dinnertime, describing the appearance of the Colossus and Armored Titans. He becomes sick as he remembers his mother being eaten, but when questioned he attributes it to eagerness to begin his training and kill all the Titans with the Survey Corps. Jean Kirstein interrupts Eren and mocks his decision.[89] Eren does not admire Jean's desire to join the Military Police simply to live in the Interior Walls and the two prepare to fight each other. The bell signaling the end of dinner rings breaking the tension and the two drop their disagreement with each other.[90]\n",
                "The next day, the trainees begin practicing with vertical maneuvering equipment. Eren utterly fails to keep himself steady and takes extra tutoring from Armin and Mikasa. He knocks himself out and at dinner, other trainees mock his performance especially after his pledge to kill all Titans.[91]\n",

                "Back at the dorm, Connie and Jean do not offer any suggestions and Eren visits Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover for help. Although they are reluctant at first, the group bonds over their similar experiences during the fall of Wall Maria. The three exchange tips and depart as friends.[92]\n",
                "Instructor Shadis gives Eren one last chance to pass his maneuvering equipment test before he will be shipped to the landfills. At first, it appears Eren can maintain his balance but Eren quickly loses control and falls over. Shadis has Eren switch equipment with Thomas Wagner and Eren finds that he is able to easily balance himself and Shadis reveals that the equipment he had been training with was defective.[93]\n",
                "During hand-to-hand combat training, Eren admits to Reiner that he finds it unnecessary, claiming that it would be much wiser to run away when attacked by another human than to engage them. Reiner reprimands him for his attitude and points Eren to Annie, who is also slacking off. Egged on by Reiner, Eren tries to attack Annie with his mock knife to punish her for slacking off and is quickly disarmed by her unconventional fighting style. She makes short work of Reiner and Eren, enthralled by Annie's proficiency, asks to know who trained her. He is taken aback when she begins to lecture him on the military's flaws, pointing out that it awards its most talented trainees with positions far away from the Titans, where their skills would be most useful.\n",
                "Annie's words continue to bother Eren, who becomes annoyed at the idea of trainees trying to improve their skills just to stay away from the Titans. Eren confronts Jean for possessing such a mentality, which leads to a physical altercation between the two. Eren easily ends the fight by replicating Annie's moves and proceeds to lecture Jean for slacking off during his training.[94] At a later point Eren and Jean got into another fight early in the morning but it was swiftly broken up by Reiner.[95]\n",

There they witness the return of the Colossus Titan, who has not been seen in the last five years. Eren faces the Titan alone in combat as his fellow trainees can all but look on in horror.[98] Despite getting close enough to the Titan to nearly slice the nape of its neck, it vanishes into thin air.[99] Reinforcements arrive and Eren's team is ordered to return to the military's headquarters for orders.\n",

However, things immediately take a turn for the worst when Thomas Wagner is devoured. Enraged, Eren tries to kill the Titan, only to be incapacitated by a second Titan biting off his leg. Eren regains consciousness just in time to save Armin from being eaten, being swallowed himself in the process.[100]\n",
                "In the stomach of the Titan, Eren comes across the dead or dying soldiers who were devoured by the Titan. As he remembers his goal to kill every last Titan alive, his anguish triggers his first transformation into his Attack Titan form. Bursting out of the Titan that devoured him, he proceeds to wreak havoc on all the Titans he finds. In the process, he unknowingly saves Mikasa’s life from another Titan and is baited by Armin, Connie, and Mikasa to help fend off a procession of Titans from a storage headquarters for the compressed gas used to power their maneuvering gear.\n",

The sight of the Titan that killed Thomas proves to be enough to drive Eren to throw off the Titans holding him down and kill the Titan by biting its nape off. As soon as the massacre is over, Eren falls to the ground and his human form emerges from the back of his Titan form’s neck, to the shock of all the onlookers. He is retrieved by an overwhelmed Mikasa.\n",
                "When he regains consciousness, Eren finds himself cornered with Armin and Mikasa by a hostile military force which has decided to execute him as a possible threat due to his powers. Due to his hazy memories of what happened during the battle Eren is unable to answer their questions satisfactorily and they fire a cannon at him and his friends. Eren instinctively grabs onto his two friends and bites his own hand, partially transforming into a Titan and blocking the cannonball with the Titan's hand.[101] While the cannon is being reloaded, Eren reveals to Mikasa and Armin that he intends to use his power to go over the wall and try to reach his father's basement on his own. Mikasa and Armin both protest the decision and Eren tells them that he will stay behind if Armin can convince the amassed soldiers not to kill him.\n",

Eren's answers satisfy Pixis and the man calls his subordinates to help devise a plan to retake Trost with Eren's powers. A plan is made for Eren to use his Titan form to reseal Trost's gate with a boulder that is in the middle of the district.\n",

When his body fails to regenerate, the mission is declared a failure. Armin arrives on the scene and convinces Mikasa to go help fend off the Titans while he tries to get through to Eren. Armin manages to rouse Eren slightly by stabbing into his Titan's nape and piercing his human body. Armin manages to bring Eren back by reminding him of their desire to see the world together, causing Eren to remember how he wanted to join the Survey Corps and destroy all the Titans.

After additional training with Reiner and Annie, Eren's prowess and skill set diversified, including the use of punches, throws, grappling and submission locks.[299] He had the best scores for hand-to-hand combat of the entire 104th graduate squad.

After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected a struggling Eren with a serum, which transformed him into a 4 meter Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a skinny body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan. Years later, during the first Battle of Trost, Eren was eaten alive by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. The sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into his Titan form for the first time.[302]\n",
                "In this form, Eren was a 15 meter tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, his Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren’s body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerted himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation.\n",

He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and was able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It had been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation and later manage to overpower and nearly kill the Armored Titan.[303]\n",

However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibit his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue.\n",

                "Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the \"Doomsday Titan\". With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[287]\n",
                "Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on Liberio by devouring Lara Tybur. He was capable of using the War Hammer's abilities to create defensive pikes and caltrops to hinder his enemies in combat. He was also capable of sealing a long tunnel with hardened Titan flesh to evade capture.[8][311]\n"

                "As I write this, the final episode of Attack on Titan has just been released. An 85-minute finale to arguably one of the best shows of the last decade.",
                "I’ll admit it — I didn’t like Attack on Titan on first watch.",
                "I never really was much of a TV person, or an anime watcher, or a horror fan. I first heard of Attack on Titan in middle school, from friends who were reading the manga. I wasn’t really into the idea of “bladed Spidermen fighting cannibal giants”, and I didn’t really see where this story could go.",
                "So I passed Attack on Titan. I only really started watching it when season four came out. I’d watched one of the trailers and I did a double take because I wasn’t sure it was the same show.",
                "So, out of curiosity, I binged Attack on Titan in a week. Starting wtih “To You, 2,000 Years From Now”, and ending with “The Dawn Of Humanity”.",
                "Then, out of pure incredulity, I binged it again.",
                "And again.",
                "And again.",
                "To say that I was awestruck, or deeply moved, or anything that can fit within a sentence, is to do injustice to the way it asks its fundamental questions to us, the viewers.",
                "I believe, firmly, that Isayama has created a modern-day epic that perfectly encapsulates the paradox and tragedy of human nature. The ending of AoT presents a perfect microcosm of the themes Isayama has woven through his work, as the Alliance assembles for a desperate final battle to save the remainder of humanity.",
                "We see the confusion and strife of humanity. We see hate and love, fear and loyalty. We see humans become monsters, all while justifying their actions as correct.",
                "Of particular note is Eren Yeager — the freedom-seeking hero-turned-villain whose choices shape the show from beginning to end. We see him seek freedom in the cruel world he was born into. We watch as, in the pursuit of freedom, he becomes the monster he once swore to destroy.",
                "But what is true freedom? And does Eren — or anyone — ever find it?",
                "For those who haven’t watched the final episode: spoilers ahead.",
                "Attack on Titan draws deeply on Norse mythology. Superficially, we have the name “Ymir”, the founder and first Titan/giant in existence. The nine Titan shifters correspond to the nine realms of Yggdrasil, all born from Ymir’s flesh. In Ragnarok, the Norse end of days, the fire jotunn of Muspelheim lay waste to the world, just as the Rumbling crushes and scorches human civilization into the dust.",
                "On a deeper level, Attack on Titan and Norse mythology also share the same narrative structure.",
                "In Norse mythology, the world is a cycle. Jormungandr, the world serpent, circles the human realm of Midgard. Ragnarok is both destruction and rebirth, with a better world being born anew from the charred branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree. Baldur, the god of light, is reborn and leads this new world.",
                "Likewise, in Attack on Titan, the Rumbling destroys the world as we know it. The survivors band together to build a new world. Armin, who had been reborn as a Titan shifter and fully understands the value of peace, heads the Alliance’s diplomatic delegation to Paradis.",
                "In both Norse mythology and Attack on Titan, time is deterministic. The future can be observed through prophecy or Titan powers. Yet, it can’t be altered.",
                "In Attack on Titan, this takes both a literal and figurative meaning. History is prewritten: the world’s destiny is set in stone, as Eren sees in his future memories.",
                "Why? Because we see, time and time again, the same actions being taken, the same mistakes being made.",
                "The Eldian Empire subjugated the world for two millennia with the Power of the Titans. Yet, when Eldia finally fell and Marley had a chance to do right, they chose to continue the cycle of war, using the Titans to conquer other countries and become another cruel superpower.",
                "Reiner goes to Paradis fully believing in his mission of saving the world from devils, only to have his mind shatter when confronted with the truth. This story continues through his cousin, Gabi, who ends up making the same mistakes and same realizations.",
                "Even when Ymir eliminates the Power of the Titans, when the ability of foresight vanishes from the world — even then, with seeming free will, war continues. Paradis is at peace for centuries, but war inevitably take its toll and leaves its cities as scarred, overgrown ruins.",
                "Every side of every war in Attack on Titan attempts to justify their actions as “correct”. We start with the mindless Titans — the epitome of a good versus evil conflict — and a clear goal: to rid the world of Titans in order to save humanity.",
                "As we uncover the existence of Titan shifters and find out the identities of the Armored, Female, and Colossal Titans, we see Reiner, Annie, and Bertholdt as the villains.",
                "In the first half of season three, the royal government — specifically, the humans making up its corrupt structure — become the villains.",
                "After the basement reveal, the villains become the entire outside world.",
                "At the beginning of season four, we watch how from the perspective of the Marleyans, the people of Paradis are the true villains, “devils” even. The Survey Corps strikes Liberio in the same way the warriors broke the Wall in season one.",
                "Back at Paradis, an increasingly corrupt military government is overthrown by the irredentist Yeagerists, who embrace Eldian exceptionalism and worship Eren as the messiah who will save them from the evils of the outside world. Here, the Yeagerists become the villains.",
                "The original Survey Corps unites with their past foes to fight against a Paradis they no longer recognize, killing comrades for the goal of stopping the Rumbling.",
                "In the end, Paradis falls into fascism, preparing for retaliation from the outside world for the Rumbling.",
                "Who is right? Who is wrong? Attack on Titan argues such questions are meaningless. No one will always succeed the test of morality, because there isn’t even such a test to begin with.",
                "Norse mythology, and likewise Attack on Titan, has no inherent morals — only motivations. Earth is born from the first murder, that of the giant Ymir by Odin, now chief of the Nordic pantheon. Countless lifeforms were born from Ymir’s dead body, desecrated by Odin for that goal.",
                "Is Ymir’s murder “right” or “wrong”? In the end, such judgements say more about the judge’s personal values than the morality of the action itself.",
                "As Eren Kruger said, there’s no singular right or wrong. It doesn’t matter whether Ymir — the first Titan shifter — was given her powers by God, the devil, or something in between. Regardless of morality, power will always be used.",
                "There are no purely selfless struggles, like there’s no truly good or evil power. To serve one’s motivations is to serve oneself. We all have our own obsessive dreams that push us to do great and terrible things.",
                "The conversation between Eren and Armin, and especially Eren’s breakdown, illustrates the paradox of struggle.",
                "In the end, Eren remains that same emotional boy who protected his friends and fought for freedom. Deep down, he wants to live the long, happy life he wishes for his friends, but knows his actions have made this dream impossible.",
                "Eren grew up enough to understand that the humans across the ocean were just like the Eldians within the Walls. Nonetheless, he chooses to ignore this newfound empathy in favour of wiping them out for his dream.",
                "The conflict inside Eren is the conflict of these three core motivations. He wants to see the world in Armin’s book — the uninhabited, unexplored world waiting to be discovered. Yet, to reach this world, he must betray his friends and sacrifice his empathy for his world.",
                "In other words, he must destroy what makes him human. He must fully become a monster.",
                "Eren has the choice, and yet he has no choice. The Rumbling is written in stone, Eren is destined to destroy the outside world — and yet, critically, he chooses to do it because that’s what he most desires.",
                "He tries to justify the atrocities he commits as being for the sake of his friends — but his friends living in peace are a consequence, rather than the main goal. It was always freedom — that hazy, vague notion of freedom beyond the Walls — that had driven him onward.",
                "It’s telling that the same OST played in Eren’s confession — that same haunting trickle of piano notes — is the same that played during Reiner’s in Season 4 Part 1. Reiner rejects the excuses Eren offers him for attacking Wall Maria — being brainwashed, having no choice — and instead admits that his actions were out of his egoistic dream to become known as a hero.",
                "We observe a quiet breakage, a tearing down of facade. Gone is warrior Reiner who killed Marco in cold blood, soldier Reiner who put his companions first. Gone is cold Eren who convinced himself of the necessity of the Rumbling to saving Paradis; soldier Eren who believed that in ridding the world of Titans, he would finally be free.",
                "Here is Reiner, the bullied boy who wanted others to respect him at any cost. Here is Eren, the caged boy who murdered eighty percent of humanity for a glimpse of his unknown world beyond the Walls.",
                "It’s the undoing of a character. What defines them, what drives them, dissolves into thin air. Faced with the approach of death, Eren and Reiner realize how meaningless their selfish choices have been.",
                "Reiner is broken by Eren. Eren’s facade cracks through meeting Ramzi, and shatters during his conversation with Armin.",
                "What separates Reiner and Eren are how they act after this breakage. Reiner chooses to continue fighting for his companions. He attempts to do what little good he can by saving others: first Falco and Gabi on Paradis, then the remainder of humanity from the Rumbling.",
                "Eren, on the other hand. chooses to keep moving forward. He becomes an empty shell of a human being: a slave to freedom.",
                "Eren, as a character, is designed to be without agency. He yearns to be free, despite knowing he will never be. He has all the power in the world, but he can’t stop himself from repeating the same mistakes as his predecessors.",
                "Eren is never special: he is just an idiot who got too much power.",
                "As Kenny Ackermann notes in his dying moments, everyone has to be drunk on something to keep moving onward. To have purpose means to serve oneself. To live with a dream is to be inherently selfish.",
                "So what do we make of this all?",
                "What purpose does it all serve to struggle?",
                "Should we become like Zeke, looking forward to the end of days and the disappearance of fear?",
                "Is life meaningless, beyond the desperate fight to survive?",
                "Isayama answers in the form of the Survey Corps. They are free: the wings of humanity, flying high above the ground, burning bright for the sake of others.",
                "The Survey Corps is the very embodiment of freedom, of beauty, of the best of humanity.",
                "To dedicate your heart, as Levi tells Erwin, is to give up on your dreams and to be willing to die, so that others have the freedom to experience the ephemeral beauty of life.",
                "So Erwin gives up on his selfish dream — finding out what’s beyond the Walls — and sacrifices himself for the sake of defeating the Beast Titan and saving the people of the Walls — his people.",
                "To some extent, we are all Zeke Yeager. Zeke, who thought the only escape from suffering was to never be born. Who only realized at the end how much meaning the simple pleasure of playing catch with Dr. Ksaver brought into his life.",
                "We are all Eren, who sought freedom so desperately he never stopped to enjoy the simple things in front of him: the seashell, for instance, which Armin hands him during their final conversation.",
                "We are all the lost characters of Attack on Titan, so obsessed with the greater world that we forget to find meaning in that which is right in front of us.",
                "The characters who make this discovery are those who are truly free.",
                "Jean abandons his dream of a “cushy life in the Interior” in order to honour his promise to Marco and to his companions in the Survey Corps.",
                "Zeke chooses to help stop the Rumbling because he discovers, through Armin, the value of small yet precious things.",
                "Gabi, the child soldier who believed her purpose was to win, finally accepts a simple life with Falco at her side, rebuilding the world.",
                "Mikasa kills Eren, her beloved, both to end his suffering and to save all the other beloved people in the world.",
                "And Ymir, after seeing what true love looks like, finally breaks free of King Fritz and ends the Titan curse.",
                "Grand things, like war, are everlasting and ugly. It’s the fleeting things — peace, love, friendship — which are truly beautiful, precisely because they don’t last.",
                "In this sense, Attack on Titan espouses spiritual freedom akin to Buddhist enlightenment. Isayama teaches us to have empathy for everyone around us. To pierce through the fog of war and understand the cyclic nature of violence. To find meaning in the rare glimpses of beauty and goodness that shine through all the strife and suffering of the world.",
                "Attack on Titan reminds us to latch on to these moments for whatever time we have. Because only then, will we transcend the cycle of conflict.",
                "Only then, will we be truly free.",

                "Eren Yeager is one of the most complex, fascinating, and talked-about characters in modern anime. As the central figure of Attack on Titan (AoT), his journey captivates audiences with its exploration of morality, vengeance, freedom, and destiny. Few protagonists in anime have undergone as much transformation—both literally and figuratively—as Eren Yeager. His decisions reverberate throughout the narrative, setting the stage for a larger commentary on human nature and the cost of survival.",
                "Whether you’re a die-hard Attack on Titan fan or just dipping your toes into its incredible story, Eren Yeager’s arc is worth diving into. Let’s explore his development, ideologies, powers, and the elements that make him an unforgettable character in the world of anime.",
                "At the heart of Attack on Titan is Eren Yeager, a young boy living behind the walls of a city that shields humanity from Titans—gigantic man-eating creatures. From the very beginning, Eren’s goals are crystal clear: he craves freedom, despises oppression, and is driven by a burning desire to wipe out Titans.",
                "Eren is introduced as a spirited teenager whose world collapses when Titans invade his home, Wall Maria. Watching his mother being devoured by a Titan spurs Eren’s thirst for vengeance and sets him on the path to becoming a member of the elite Survey Corps, the group tasked with fighting Titans and uncovering their secrets.",
                "His early characterization resonates with viewers. He’s passionate, idealistic, and somewhat impulsive. But as the series unfolds, Eren grows into a character far more complex than your average anime protagonist.",
                "One of the defining aspects of Eren Yeager’s character is his evolution. He begins as a heroic figure, dedicated to protecting humanity. Yet, as the series progresses, he takes a darker turn.",
                "Eren’s transformation can be traced to the revelation of the Titans’ origins and the history of the world beyond the walls. His quest for freedom shifts from fighting external threats to questioning humanity itself. He begins to see himself as a savior, but his methods become increasingly ruthless. This moral ambiguity is what makes Eren Yeager such an enthralling figure—he forces audiences to grapple with difficult questions about justice, revenge, and sacrifice.",
                "Consider this: Is Eren still a hero when he uses the power of the Founding Titan to unleash the Rumbling? His decision to flatten entire nations to secure the future of Paradis Island polarizes viewers. On one hand, he fulfills his promise to protect his homeland. On the other hand, the devastation he causes raises ethical questions about the cost of his actions.",
                "Eren’s power as a Titan Shifter is central to his character. Unlike regular humans, Eren can transform into a Titan at will, granting him immense physical strength and regenerative abilities. Over the course of the series, Eren gains control over multiple Titan forms:",
                "These abilities make Eren a formidable figure, but they also come with immense responsibility. As the story progresses, his mastery of these powers reflects his inner transformation—from a boy wanting to destroy Titans to a man challenging the world’s power structures.",
                "Eren Yeager’s actions are motivated by a deep-rooted belief in freedom. His mantra, “If you don’t fight, you can’t win,” encapsulates his philosophy. This relentless pursuit of liberation drives many of his decisions.",
                "However, Eren’s concept of freedom is nuanced. It evolves from a personal dream of exploring the world beyond the walls to a collective goal of securing a future for his people. In doing so, Eren wrestles with questions about the price of freedom. Is it right to sacrifice others for one’s ideals? How do you reconcile personal dreams with the larger good?",
                "Eren’s relationships with other characters form the emotional backbone of Attack on Titan. Here are the key dynamics that shape his journey:",
                "Eren’s quest for freedom is a recurring theme in Attack on Titan. His journey examines what it means to be free, the sacrifices it demands, and whether true freedom is even attainable in a flawed world.",
                "Eren’s transformation challenges traditional notions of good and evil. Is he a villain for causing destruction or a savior acting in the best interest of his people? The series invites viewers to question the morality of Eren’s choices.",
                "As a Titan Shifter with world-altering abilities, Eren grapples with the immense weight of responsibility. His decisions carry consequences not only for himself but for all of humanity.",
                "Eren’s determination to rise above loss and trauma serves as an inspiring reminder of the importance of perseverance.",
                "Eren’s actions highlight the duality of humanity—capable of both great love and destruction.",
                "Through Eren’s journey, Attack on Titan pushes us to reconsider black-and-white definitions of right and wrong.",
                "Also read: 123movierulz: Everything You Need to Know in 2025",
                "Eren Yeager’s character is a masterclass in storytelling. From his initial innocence to his ultimate transformation into a morally complex figure, Eren’s journey mirrors the grand questions of humanity: What does it mean to be free? What are we willing to sacrifice for our ideals? Through triumphs and tragedies, Eren Yeager reminds us that the pursuit of freedom is never straightforward—it’s as messy and multifaceted as human nature itself.",
                "Eren is driven by a deep desire for freedom stemming from personal trauma and a longing to explore the world beyond the walls.",
                "Eren’s transformation into an antihero occurs as he adopts ruthless methods to achieve his goal of protecting Paradis Island, blurring the line between hero and villain.",
                "Eren can transform into the Attack Titan, Founding Titan, and War Hammer Titan, each offering unique abilities crucial to the story.",
                "Eren and Mikasa share a deep bond rooted in mutual protection and care, though their dynamic evolves as Eren grows more distant in later arcs.",
                "The Rumbling showcases Eren’s ultimate plan to secure freedom for Paradis, but it also illustrates the devastating cost of his actions.",
                "Eren’s journey, marked by transformation, moral ambiguity, and philosophical questions about freedom, makes him one of the most multi-dimensional characters in anime history.",
