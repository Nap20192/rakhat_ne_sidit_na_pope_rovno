The image has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and is a standard aspect ratio commonly used in computer graphics and web design.

    "2.jpg": " This is a photograph of an individual standing at the open door of an airplane. The person appears to be wearing formal attire, including what seems to be a suit and tie, with their right hand raised in a gesture that might suggest waving or greeting someone. The name \"Air India\" is visible on the aircraft's exterior. The photo captures a moment of transition, as the plane is parked on the tarmac with stairs leading up to it, indicating either boarding or disembarkation. There are no other people visible in the immediate vicinity of the airplane door. "
